Thibaut Durand / Hans Lucas / Hans Lucas via AFP  Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher to start the new trading week as markets further digested the results of last week's election and the latest interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
  The S&P 500 added 0.1% on Monday. The Nasdaq wavered for most of the day but closed with a gain of a bit less than 0.1%, with surging cryptocurrency prices buoying shares of tech firms with ties to crypto. The Dow built on its post-election rally, jumping 0.7% to notch its first-ever close above 44,000. Bond markets were closed in observance of Veterans Day.
  Shares of pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) popped 10.5% higher, logging the top daily performance in the S&P 500, after competitor AbbVie (ABBV) reported that its experimental schizophrenic treatment failed to reach the desired goals in a Phase 2 trial. Bristol-Myers Squibb entered the schizophrenia treatment market through last year's acquisition of biopharma firm Karuna Therapeutics, whose drug KarXT received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in September. AbbVie shares plunged 12.6% on Monday.
  Albemarle (ALB) shares jumped 9.6%, continuing their march higher since the world's largest lithium miner released third-quarter results last week. Although Albemarle reported a net loss of $1.1 billion, the company announced a 50% reduction in capital expenditures in 2025, as well as other cost-cutting measures that include laying off around 6% of its global workforce. Analysts suggested these moves could help Albemarle navigate low lithium prices, which the company expects to persist for some time.
  Tesla (TSLA) shares surged 9%, extending a string of gains posted in the wake of last week's election. There are expectations that Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and vocal supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, will play an advisory role in the next administration, where he could advocate on issues like tariffs and tax credits. Analysts at Wedbush lifted their price target on Tesla shares by $100, saying Trump's election could be transformative for the company's automation and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions.
  The weakest performance in the S&P 500 came from shares of Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), which plummeted 15%. The move followed a report by market analysis firm Edgewater Research indicating that semiconductor behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) could reduce or cancel its use of Monolithic Power's voltage regulation module in its next-generation AI chips.  
  Vaccine maker Moderna (MRNA) reported a surprise third-quarter profit when it released its results last week, but the stock has been moving lower since then, dropping an additional 8.7% on Monday. Despite the strong performance in the recent quarter, analysts expressed uncertainty about future vaccine demand as well as Moderna's ability to maintain market share.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR, Financials) shares dropped by double digits in premarket trading Monday following a report from Edgewater Research indicating potential risks to the company's allocation in Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell GPU line. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Edgewater analysts said that Monolithic's allocation in Blackwell might be drastically limited or eliminated by performance problems with its voltage regulator modules and power management integrated circuits. Given both businesses got recent rush orders, Japanese semiconductor company Renesas and Germany's Infineon Technologies may absorb Monolithic's share; Renesas reportedly took up the B200 allocation and Infineon possibly managing the GB200. Though it might result from a product failure in Blackwell's setups, where power usage topped 700 watts, Edgewater experts indicated the source of Monolithic's power management IC problem is ""unclear."" Though Monolithic may maintain shipments for B300A (700 watts), this performance issue leaves Monolithic with ""limited or no"" allocations for B200 (1,000 watts) and GB200 (1,200 watts). The analysts also said that while Nvidia is probably looking at Monolithic's confirmed orders for next quarters, it has already canceled about half of Monolithic's backlog, therefore affecting all unverified orders. By early 2025, they stated Nvidia may raise Renesas's part of the Hopper GPU allocation to 50% from around 15% in the fourth quarter of 2024. Infineon hasn't yet qualified as a Hopper supplier however. Edgewater claims that while Monolithic's latest solutions are just short patches rather than long-term solutions, Nvidia's engineering staff has apparently turned trust toward Renesas and Infineon as main suppliers. We view this as creating a substantial downside risk for MPWR's Enterprise Data segment in 2025, the analysts concluded, stressing issues over the possible effect on Monolithic's shares, especially amid investor attention on the company's AI-related performance.

Morgan Stanley (MS, Financial) has raised its price target for Nvidia (NVDA, Financial) from $150 to $160, citing Nvidia's recent bullish performance and anticipated easing of supply-chain challenges. Morgan Stanley analysts, led by Joseph Moore, forecast that Nvidia's new Blackwell product line will significantly boost revenue in the January quarter, with expected sales in the $5-6 billion range. However, these potential gains may face some offset due to ongoing supply constraints, which could affect current quarter guidance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. Additionally, Nvidia's product demand trends reveal a shift from the H100 to increased demand for the H200, aligning with Nvidia's recent pattern of raising its sales guidance by approximately $2 billion. Analysts estimate Nvidia's January quarter revenue guidance could surpass consensus at $36.5 billion. Morgan Stanley also predicts an increase in Nvidia's gross margins through FY2026, though initial Blackwell ramp-up margins are expected to be lower. Nvidia's previous gross margin guidance dropped from 75.7% in July to 75.0% in October, a conservative estimate according to Morgan Stanley. Consequently, the firm has raised its FY26 revenue and EPS estimates for Nvidia to $176.78 billion and $4.03, with 73.8% non-GAAP gross margins.

Digital assets such as bitcoin could be poised for greatness under Trump, with Wall Street wunderkind Nvidia (NVDA) in a good position to benefit. “I think there are a lot of ways that the government could show support for crypto over the next few months,” EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). “Trump’s talk about doing a strategic Bitcoin reserve is bullish as an underlying bid for that currency,” said Jackson. To that end, bitcoin topped $80,000 for the first time on Sunday as its bullish run post Election Day rages on. The price of bitcoin has rallied 15% in the past five days, according to Yahoo Finance data. While on the campaign trail, Trump did not shy away from expressing his enthusiasm for digital assets. He even promised to make the nation a crypto friendly place, forecasting the US could become the “crypto capital of the planet” at this year’s Bitcoin 2024 conference.

Jackson has been watching Nvidia and its evolution for the past seven or so years. Although Nvidia's powerful chips rose to fame in the gaming space, its products were also mission critical to the development of cryptocurrency in its early days. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to assist crypto miners due to their speed and efficiency. As the demand for crypto potentially picks up under Trump, it could fuel orders for Nvidia's latest computing chips, on top of its applications for AI and Tesla (TSLA) robots. “Bitcoin mining itself will probably make a comeback if crypto does take another leg up,” said Jackson. Jackson fancies Nvidia shares could more than double given its wide competitive advantages in chip development over rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC). It's a bullish view echoed by Jackson's peers at the likes of Bank of America. “Crypto is emerging as this alternative money class,” Jackson added. One challenge is bringing the currency to the masses in a tangible, digestible way. Jackson envisions support for the digital currency industry under the Trump administration that could include “promoting approvals for all kinds of ETFs.” ""Getting those stocks approved by the SEC is obviously going to give people a lot more choices so they don’t have to just directly invest in crypto.” However it plays out over the coming years, Jackson remains optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies overall. “[There’s] more fun ahead,” he said.

news,2024-11-11 06:00:00,NVIDIA Corp: An Exploration into Its Intrinsic Value,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corp-exploration-intrinsic-value-110016235.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In this article, we will take a look into NVIDIA Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) DCF analysis, a reliable and data-driven approach to estimating its intrinsic value. Instead of using future free cash flow as in the traditional DCF model, the GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default for the DCF model based on research that shows that historically stock prices have been more correlated with earnings than free cash flow. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with NVDA. As of 2024-11-11, NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value as calculated by the Discounted Earnings model is $67.34. It's currently trading at a price of $147.63. Therefore, the margin of safety based on the DCF model is -119.23%. The company is significantly overvalued. The GuruFocus DCF calculator follows a two-stage model by default. This model consists of the Growth Stage and the Terminal Stage. In the growth stage, the company is experiencing faster growth, while in the terminal stage, a lower growth rate is applied because sustained rapid growth is not sustainable in the long run. NVIDIA Corp's intrinsic value estimated by Discounted Earnings model are arrived at by following assumptions and steps. Term Value Explanation EPS without NRI $2.16 GuruFocus DCF calculator uses EPS without NRI as the default because historically stock prices are more correlated to earnings than free cash flow. Discount Rate 11% An appropriate discount rate is typically the risk-free rate plus the risk premium of the stock market. GuruFocus uses the current 10-year Treasury Constant Maturity Rate of 4.31%, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which is 5%. A 6% risk premium is then added to arrive at the estimated discount rate. Growth Stage Growth rate (g1) = 41.10% Years of Growth Stage = 10 We choose the growth rate based on the availability, prioritizing the average EPS without NRI growth rate from the past 10, 5, or 3 years in that order, and then capping between 5% and 20% to maintain a fair and balanced estimate. The default growth period is set to 10 years. Terminal Stage Growth rate (g2) = 4% Years of Terminal Stage = 10 For the terminal stage, the eps will grow at 4% for 10 years. It is important to ensure that the terminal growth rate remains lower than the discount rate to facilitate convergence in the calculation. Growth Stage = EPS without NRI * [ (1 + g1) / (1 + d) * (1 + g1) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 101.19 Terminal Stage = EPS without NRI * (1 + g1) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 * [ (1 + g2) / (1 + d) + (1 + g2) ^ 2 / (1 + d) ^ 2 + ... + (1 + g2) ^ 10 / (1 + d) ^ 10 ] = 168.84 Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based) = Growth Stage + Terminal Stage = 67.34 GuruFocus also provides the calculation using the traditional approach of free cash flow. Using trailing twelve month(ttm) Free Cash Flow per Share as a parameter, the DCF intrinsic value based on free cash flow is $58.75. This valuation indicates that the NVIDIA Corp is significantly overvalued, accompanied by a margin of safety of -151.29%. You can always switch to using Free Cash Flow per Share to calculate the real DCF model on our DCF calculator page. Please note that while the DCF model is a robust valuation methodology, it relies on various assumptions and projections that may affect the accuracy of the final intrinsic value calculation. Here are some considerations when employing the DCF model: Future Earnings Potential: The DCF model evaluates a company based on its potential future earnings. Embracing Growth: Growth plays a pivotal role. All else being equal, a company with rapid growth will have a higher value. Predictability: The model assumes that a company will grow at the same rate as its past 10-year performance, making it a better fit for companies with consistent performance. For companies with unpredictable performance, such as cyclical companies, the DCF model may be less accurate and a larger margin of safety should be emphasized. Discount Rate: Selecting an appropriate discount rate is paramount. Using your anticipated return on investment is a sensible choice for the discount rate. Using the GuruFocus All-in-One Screener, you can easily screen for stocks that are currently trading below their intrinsic value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based). To identify undervalued predictable companies, focus on those with a high Predictability Rank that are trading at a discount to their Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) and Intrinsic Value: DCF (Earnings Based).

news,2024-11-11 05:06:00,OpenAI and rivals are looking to develop smarter AI that could change a market dominated by Nvidia,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-rivals-seek-path-smarter-100616130.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Refiles unchanged to fix format issues) By Krystal Hu, Anna Tong (Reuters) -Artificial intelligence companies like OpenAI are seeking to overcome unexpected delays and challenges in the pursuit of ever-bigger large language models by developing training techniques that use more human-like ways for algorithms to ""think"". A dozen AI scientists, researchers and investors told Reuters they believe that these techniques, which are behind OpenAI's recently released o1 model, could reshape the AI arms race, and have implications for the types of resources that AI companies have an insatiable demand for, from energy to types of chips. OpenAI declined to comment for this story. After the release of the viral ChatGPT chatbot two years ago, technology companies, whose valuations have benefited greatly from the AI boom, have publicly maintained that “scaling up” current models through adding more data and computing power will consistently lead to improved AI models. But now, some of the most prominent AI scientists are speaking out on the limitations of this “bigger is better” philosophy. Ilya Sutskever, co-founder of AI labs Safe Superintelligence (SSI) and OpenAI, told Reuters recently that results from scaling up pre-training - the phase of training an AI model that uses a vast amount of unlabeled data to understand language patterns and structures - have plateaued. Sutskever is widely credited as an early advocate of achieving massive leaps in generative AI advancement through the use of more data and computing power in pre-training, which eventually created ChatGPT. Sutskever left OpenAI earlier this year to found SSI. “The 2010s were the age of scaling, now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing,” Sutskever said. “Scaling the right thing matters more now than ever.” Sutskever declined to share more details on how his team is addressing the issue, other than saying SSI is working on an alternative approach to scaling up pre-training. Behind the scenes, researchers at major AI labs have been running into delays and disappointing outcomes in the race to release a large language model that outperforms OpenAI’s GPT-4 model, which is nearly two years old, according to three sources familiar with private matters. The so-called ‘training runs’ for large models can cost tens of millions of dollars by simultaneously running hundreds of chips. They are more likely to have hardware-induced failure given how complicated the system is; researchers may not know the eventual performance of the models until the end of the run, which can take months. Another problem is large language models gobble up huge amounts of data, and AI models have exhausted all the easily accessible data in the world. Power shortages have also hindered the training runs, as the process requires vast amounts of energy. To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring “test-time compute,” a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called “inference” phase, or when the model is being used. For example, instead of immediately choosing a single answer, a model could generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time, ultimately choosing the best path forward. This method allows models to dedicate more processing power to challenging tasks like math or coding problems or complex operations that demand human-like reasoning and decision-making. “It turned out that having a bot think for just 20 seconds in a hand of poker got the same boosting performance as scaling up the model by 100,000x and training it for 100,000 times longer,” said Noam Brown, a researcher at OpenAI who worked on o1, at TED AI conference in San Francisco last month. OpenAI has embraced this technique in their newly released model known as ""o1,” formerly known as Q* and Strawberry, which Reuters first reported in July. The O1 model can ""think"" through problems in a multi-step manner, similar to human reasoning. It also involves using data and feedback curated from PhDs and industry experts. The secret sauce of the o1 series is another set of training carried out on top of ‘base’ models like GPT-4, and the company says it plans to apply this technique with more and bigger base models. At the same time, researchers at other top AI labs, from Anthropic, xAI, and Google DeepMind, have also been working to develop their own versions of the technique, according to five people familiar with the efforts. “We see a lot of low-hanging fruit that we can go pluck to make these models better very quickly,” said Kevin Weil, chief product officer at OpenAI at a tech conference in October. “By the time people do catch up, we're going to try and be three more steps ahead.” Google and xAI did not respond to requests for comment and Anthropic had no immediate comment. The implications could alter the competitive landscape for AI hardware, thus far dominated by insatiable demand for Nvidia’s AI chips. Prominent venture capital investors, from Sequoia to Andreessen Horowitz, who have poured billions to fund expensive development of AI models at multiple AI labs including OpenAI and xAI, are taking notice of the transition and weighing the impact on their expensive bets. “This shift will move us from a world of massive pre-training clusters toward inference clouds, which are distributed, cloud-based servers for inference,” Sonya Huang, a partner at Sequoia Capital, told Reuters. Demand for Nvidia’s AI chips, which are the most cutting edge, has fueled its rise to becoming the world’s most valuable company, surpassing Apple in October. Unlike training chips, where Nvidia dominates, the chip giant could face more competition in the inference market. Asked about the possible impact on demand for its products, Nvidia pointed to recent company presentations on the importance of the technique behind the o1 model. Its CEO Jensen Huang has talked about increasing demand for using its chips for inference. ""We've now discovered a second scaling law, and this is the scaling law at a time of inference...All of these factors have led to the demand for Blackwell being incredibly high,"" Huang said last month at a conference in India, referring to the company's latest AI chip.

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s stock has almost tripled this year, and Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly positive on the chipmaker. Most Read from Bloomberg The Leaf Blowers Will Not Go Quietly Arizona Elections Signal Robust Immigration Enforcement Under Trump Scoring an Architectural Breakthrough in Denver’s RiNo District Key Ballot Initiatives and Local Races Highlight Views on Abortion, Immigration But, Terry Smith isn’t impressed. The money manager, who’s been dubbed by the UK press as Britain’s Warren Buffett, is skeptical as he says the world’s largest stock lacks a predictable earnings stream and a strong track record of high return on capital. Smith is avoiding the shares even as he acknowledges that such a move undercuts his portfolio’s performance. “I’m not confident that we know what the future of AI is because there are almost no applications people are paying for,” Smith said in a Nov. 5 interview in Tokyo. “Will they be willing to pay on a sufficient scale and a sufficient price to justify this? Because if not, the suppliers of the chips are going to have a problem.” Smith’s caution strikes at one of the biggest concerns about the future of the artificial intelligence industry: will the revenue generated by the technology ultimately justify the billions of dollars of investments the firms have plowed in? The doubts contributed to a selloff which erased about $900 billion from Nvidia’s market value from a June peak to an August low, although the shares have since rebounded. AI enthusiasts note that Nvidia’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc., have pledged to pump more into capital spending after splashing a record $59 billion into data center gear and other fixed assets in the third quarter. Strategists expect the company to record a net profit margin of 56% in the 2025 fiscal year as tech firms continue to boost AI spending to keep up with rivals. But, Smith thinks such hefty margins may not last. “Even if AI is the next big thing and we’re going to be paying enough money to justify it, is there just going to be one manufacturer of these chips?” he said. “If you are making fantastic returns, it attracts competition.” “In fact, if you look at the people who are the big users of the microprocessors that Nvidia is supplying, such as Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle, they have a history of developing their own,” he added. Smith’s Fundsmith Equity Fund returned 9% this year in dollar terms, trailing the MSCI World Index of developing-market stocks which has gained almost 20%. The underperformance is due to “concentration of performance amongst a handful of stocks,” Smith said, adding that the rising popularity of index funds is fueling this trend. “The popularity of index funds is worrying,” he said. “A lot of people call them passive. But they are not passive. They are momentum strategy. And the momentum will last until it doesn’t.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek ‘I’m Suffering’: What the 2024 Election Taught Me About America How a Winning Bet on Crypto Could Transform Brain and Longevity Science The Crypto World’s Victory Lap Begins What Trump Can Do to Workers’ Biden-Era Gains Why the Washington Commanders Are the Most Exciting Team in the NFL ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Click here to access exclusive investment research and ad free browsing! Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive research! We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Ken Fisher. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. Ken Fisher is a prominent American investor and financial analyst, known for founding Fisher Investments in 1979. Born in San Francisco in 1950, he is the son of influential stock investor Philip A. Fisher. Fisher graduated from Humboldt State University with a degree in economics in 1972. He began his career in investment management and quickly made a name for himself through innovative approaches to investment theory. Under Fisher’s leadership, the firm has been recognized for its investment strategies and has consistently ranked among the top investment advisers in the U.S. For several years, Fisher Investments has been included in the Financial Times’ list of top Registered Investment Advisors. Fisher is also a best-selling author, having written multiple books on investment strategies, and he is known for popularizing concepts like the Price-to-Sales ratio as a tool for stock analysis Ken Fisher talked about the markets in a September 2024 video that was posted on his firm’s YouTube channel, Fisher Investments, and mentioned that he frequently gets asked about which sectors he believes will outperform or underperform over the next 18 months. He currently sees the market in the later stages, though not at the end, of a somewhat unusual bull market shaped by the unique challenges since COVID-19 began. As this bull market nears its two-year mark in October, he observes that while major trends may not shift significantly in the immediate future, technology stocks have consistently outperformed non-tech stocks since the market began to recover from the pandemic. Fisher noted that, when the market sees substantial movement, up or down by half a percent or more, technology stocks tend to follow that trend more intensely. Thus, if the market is expected to rise, tech stocks will likely perform well; conversely, they often lag during market downturns. Ken Fisher noted that as 2024 progressed, he expected value stocks to begin outperforming growth stocks more than they had in the past. While this expectation did not materialize in the first and second quarters, he observed that the trend started to emerge in the third quarter. However, he was surprised to see that energy stocks continued to underperform compared to most value stocks. “As 2024 progressed, and as I said in prior videos early in the year, I expected value to start doing better relative to growth than it had been before. And that didn’t really much happen in the first and second quarters. But in the third quarter of 2024, that’s largely happened, with the exception of the fact that energy, and I was completely wrong about this, energy has continued to do worse than most value.” Additionally, Fisher said that initially when the Fed began raising rates in 2022, many thought this would negatively impact growth stocks, a narrative he consistently disagreed with. Now, the sentiment is shifting again, suggesting that central bank rate cuts will benefit value stocks while adversely affecting growth stocks. This shift is logical because value stocks are more reliant on bank financing compared to growth stocks, which have various funding sources. As short-term interest rates decline relative to long-term rates and banks become more willing to lend, this scenario favors value stocks. Consequently, Fisher anticipates that the trend of value stocks narrowing the gap with growth stocks, seen in the third quarter, will continue into the fourth quarter and throughout much of the next year. Our Methodology This article explores the top ten stock holdings of Fisher Asset Management, based on 13F filings as of Q2 2024. The stocks are arranged in ascending order according to the stake of Fisher Asset Management, as of June 30, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

The company’s positive outlook is bolstered by its leadership in the AI and machine learning sectors, where its GPUs are crucial for powering advanced applications, positioning NVIDIA to capitalize on the growing adoption of AI solutions across industries. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s data center segment is also experiencing rapid growth, fueled by the rise in AI and cloud computing as organizations migrate to these services, placing NVIDIA to capture a significant share of this expanding market. With a strong financial foundation, NVIDIA continues to invest heavily in research and development, ensuring it remains at the forefront of innovation. Its robust cash flow further enables strategic acquisitions and partnerships to drive accelerated growth. In Q3 2024, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) surpassed estimates, reporting a normalized EPS of $0.68, beating projections by $0.04, with revenue of $30.04 billion, exceeding forecasts by $1.29 billion. As NVIDIA approaches its Q4 earnings report on November 20, 2024, analysts project a normalized EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $32.94 billion. Over the last 90 days, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has received 32 upward EPS revisions, reflecting strong investor confidence in its sustained momentum and leadership within the semiconductor industry. ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “This focus on consistency also guides our regular trimming of strong performers to manage stock-specific and overall portfolio risk. The quarter saw us continue to trim NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), reducing the GPU chipmaker from an active weight in the portfolio to an underweight versus the benchmark. We continue to believe in Nvidia’s 10-year trajectory as hyperscaler and enterprise customers invest in GPU architecture. However, we have reduced our Nvidia position as its valuation now more fully reflects the company’s robust growth path and as estimates have risen to levels that require a very steep growth trajectory to drive further stock appreciation.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy according to billionaire Ken Fisher. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

news,2024-11-10 11:23:00,Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Stock to Buy and Hold for 5 Years?,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporation-nvda-best-stock-162334223.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold For 5 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. On November 7, Reuters reported that stocks in the United States were higher than usual after the Fed announced a 25 basis point rate cut, extending the rally fueled by the election results. The Fed decision came promptly after the job market showed signs of easing and inflation moved towards the Central Bank’s target of 2%. Most investors expect the new administration to ease taxes and regulations, all of which sparked all three of the major indexes. The S&P 500 and Dow, each logged their largest one-day percentage jumps in two years. Now that the elections are over, investors are keen to know how will markets perform amid election results. On November 8, Bethany McLean, contributing editor at Vanity Fair, joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss why businesses may be optimistic as the new president takes over the White House. McLean emphasizes that investors foresee a myriad of benefits such as tax cut extensions, fewer regulations, and less aggressive antitrust oversight, all of which have sparked a surge in markets. Despite the possible benefits, she emphasizes it is difficult to predict what the administration is going to do at the moment. McLean expects the new administration to be friendlier with companies in the technology sector, however, she remains fixated on waiting to see how the policies play out. She further adds that if any future policies made by the new administration negatively impact the stock market, she expects them to “switch course.” On the flip side, some analysts maintain that the easing cycle has a greater bearing on the stock market than the elections, hinting that value names may be more important as of now. On November 7, Arup Datta, senior vice president at Mackenzie Global Quantitative, joined Wealth! on Yahoo Finance to share his market thesis as the 2024 elections come to a close. Datta shares that he is extremely positive about the market but emphasizes that the win will have little impact on financial markets in the long term. Speaking of the magnificent seven, he adds focusing on quality names with positive growth and value for his investment portfolio helps him navigate the market in such conditions. He suggests that while the magnificent seven have been the talk of the town for the past 18 to 21 months, he would like to “pivot away” from that by a little. Historically, value stocks have performed better amid an easing cycle, adds Datta. As the new administration settles in and the Fed initiates its second cut of the cycle, the near-term market will most likely remain volatile. Speaking of the future, some names happen to promise long-term growth due to their proprietary revolutionary technologies and crucial investments. To come up with the 10 best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years, we sifted through multiple similar rankings and compiled an initial list of 20 stocks. We then ranked the top 10 based on their hedge fund sentiment at the end of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Photo by Christian Wiediger on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks third on our list of the best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. NVIDIA is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. There is no doubt about NVIDIA’s position in the technology and AI sector. As part of its recent updates, On October 29, the company revealed Enterprise Reference Architectures. These blueprints will help the company’s partners and customers build AI factories. More recently, on November 6, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) partnered with Hugging Face to fuel open-source AI robotics research and development. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is scheduled to release earnings towards the end of this month, on November 20, 2024. In light of its awaited earning release, on October 19, Vivek Arya analyst at Bank of America, joined CNBC to defend his bullish call on NVDA. Having called the stock a “generational opportunity,” Arya emphasizes that NVDA is trading less than one times its earnings growth, much lower than other names in the magnificent seven. He suggests that NVDA celebrates a large ecosystem encompassing “end-to-end” knowledge, placing it ahead of competitors. Overall, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on our list because of its resources and expertise in scalable AI hardware and software solutions. At the end of Q2 2024, 179 hedge funds were bullish on the stock, according to our Insider Monkey database. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of best stocks to buy and hold for 5 years. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

news,2024-11-10 08:30:00,Trump presidency likely won't be a problem for Nvidia's stock,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-presidency-likely-wont-be-a-problem-for-nvidias-stock-133020558.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues.

This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Donald Trump's return to the White House has me wondering about the world's most beloved stock, Nvidia (NVDA). Is a Trump presidency going to be good or bad for the AI market darling? Has he ever taken CEO Jensen Huang to task on X? Does Jensen feel a certain way about Trump, and perhaps could add headline risk to the company's stock price? All of this matters since, as I mentioned, Nvidia has become the market — even before its inclusion in the former smokestack index known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). The short answer to all of these pressing questions is, who really knows? I can't find a lot. Do an advanced search of Trump's X account, and you do not unearth a single post on Jensen or Nvidia. Scour interviews of Jensen from the prior Trump presidency, and there isn't much for Trump to feast on as he returns to the Oval Office. ""I’m optimistic about the outcome, irrespective of how, on balance, I prefer a more liberal government. I have confidence in the resilience of the institutions. We’ll find a way through and find a way forward,"" Huang said in a November 2016 VentureBeat story following Trump's first White House win. Huang is besties with Tesla (TSLA) CEO and Trump supporter Elon Musk, but it's unclear what that means for Nvidia's financial fortunes over the next four years. Chat up investors, and the early vibe is that Nvidia should do just fine, as the factors driving its business are simply too powerful to be snuffed out. ""It's hard to draw a straight line between AI or Nvidia and Trump,"" EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). ""I think there's some interesting ways that AI is kind of infiltrating all corners of tech. But in general, obviously, Trump is very pro-growth, low taxes, and that's going to sweep up all of tech and that includes AI."" Jackson thinks Nvidia could see stronger demand from the bitcoin mining industry, as Trump may open up the digital asset markets more. Nvidia could also cash in from looser regulations on the energy industry, freeing up hyperscalers to move more quickly with AI infrastructure buildouts, Jackson reasoned. One risk to watch, Jackson said, is if a tariff-induced trade war with China occurs. Nvidia not only sells chips in China but has important product development talent in the country. You also have to keep in mind what this trade war would mean to China's relationship with key chip producer Taiwan. But by and large, Nvidia is poised to continue being Nvidia, experts say. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya told me the company's next three chips after Blackwell — Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra — could be huge performers. Those offerings will begin hitting the market in Q3 2025 based on Arya's analysis. Yahoo Finance data shows analysts estimating Nvidia's earnings growth to hit 43% at $4.08 a share in 2025. Looks conservative to me based on all the conversations I've been having. I could easily make the case Nvidia does $5 a share in earnings next year. Assuming a P/E multiple of 40 times as opposed to the rather low 37 times currently, Nvidia is a $200 stock compared to $148 today. Jackson thinks the stock is worth a minimum of $250.   It's hard to see how a Trump presidency unravels this potential future earnings power in 2025 — if anything it may ignite it. ""Trump is a clear bullish foundation for Big Tech. We believe Musk will help navigate the China issues so they don’t negatively impact the yin and yang for US tech and the AI Revolution. And with Lina Khan [likely] out at the FTC, Nvidia will be more aggressive on tech M&A,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said. Having laid this out, what can go wrong?

news,2024-11-10 07:45:00,Inflation and retail sales data greet a roaring stock market rally: What to know this week,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inflation-and-retail-sales-data-greet-a-roaring-stock-market-rally-what-to-know-this-week-124552744.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks just had their best week of 2024. All three major indexes pressed to record highs after Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 4.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose nearly 6%. In the week ahead, a fresh reading on inflation and retail sales will lead the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Home Depot (HD), Cisco (CSCO), and Disney (DIS) will highlight another week of earnings reports. In a widely anticipated move, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points last Thursday. In a press conference following the announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell declined to comment on the central bank's plans for future rate cuts. ""We don’t think it’s a good time to be doing a lot of forward guidance,"" Powell said. He later noted that Fed officials will need to gauge the economic data released between now and December before knowing if the central bank will cut interest rates again this year. The first data the Fed will consider ahead of its next meeting will come out on Wednesday with the release of the October Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street economists expect headline inflation rose just 2.6% annually in October, an increase from the 2.4% rise in September. Prices are set to rise 0.2% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, in line with the increase seen in September. On a ""core"" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is forecast to have risen 3.3% over last year in October, unchanged from September's increase. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, also in line with the September gain. ""The October CPI report will likely support the notion that the last mile of inflation's journey back to target will be the hardest,"" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. The final monthly retail sales report before the start of the holiday shopping season is set for release on Thursday. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.3% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.3%. Entering the release, several trackers point to the fourth quarter being off to a solid start for economic growth. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow tracker currently projects the US economy growing at 2.5%. Disney is set to report quarterly results before the bell on Thursday as the media giant looks to continue to improve its streaming business amid further declines in linear television. Investors will also be focused on results within the company's theme park business after the segment fell short in its most recent quarter.  Streaming profitability should be a bright spot after the company reported its first quarter of profits for that business in August. The segment should get a boost from recent price hikes along with the continued rollout of Disney's password-sharing crackdown across its various platforms. Shares are up about 9% this year. In a roaring rally over the final three trading sessions of the week, much has been made about trades like financials that could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's policy. Big Tech also saw significant upside. Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) — which tracks Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — hit a fresh record highs on both Thursday and Friday. Three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, Tesla, Nvidia, and Amazon, outpaced the S&P 500 on the week, with Alphabet also coming close. Tesla had a unique Trump-related catalyst, with investors banking on CEO Elon Musk's big bet on the president-elect's campaign paying off.  Broadly, markets seemed to be pricing in the potential for less government regulation over Big Tech in a second Trump term. Perhaps indicative of the tech industry's high hopes, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai all rushed to congratulate Trump on his victory. The week's stock moves also coincided with a surge in Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) nearly hitting 4.5%. Strategists have often cited a ""flight to quality"" environment when yields rise, where money flows to large corporations with solid earnings growth and healthy balance sheets. Big Tech fits this mold and saw a rally when yields rose back in the spring. Small caps were one of the beneficiaries of the post-Trump election rally. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) small-cap index jumped more than 5% on Wednesday for its best day in nearly two years. It closed the week up more than 8% for its best week since April 2020 and is now closing in on its all-time high. This leaves investors with a question that's been prompted throughout 2024: With the Fed set to keep lowering interest rates, is now the time to pile into small caps? In a Friday webinar, Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz said not yet. The index has more short-term debt than the S&P 500 and would be a clear beneficiary of lower interest rates. But it also has another key difference from large-cap indexes right now: Earnings estimates aren't rising. While Kantrowitz's research shows 2024 full-year earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have increased over the last 90 days, earnings estimates for the small-cap S&P 600 (^SP600) index have been falling. ""In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower,"" Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. ""[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet,"" Kantrowitz said.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news and ratings you should not miss. As tools like ChatGPT by OpenAI become more popular, a larger debate has been ignited among AI businesses in the United States over content creation and copyrights. AI startup OpenAI, the most valuable private firm in the world, recently won an important battle in this regard when a New York federal judge on November 7 dismissed a lawsuit against the company that alleged that the startup had misused articles from news outlets Raw Story and AlterNet to train its large language models. A spokesperson for the startup said in a statement following the ruling that OpenAI had built their AI models using publicly available data, in a manner protected by fair use and related principles, and supported by long-standing and widely accepted legal precedents. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The win is likely to further boost the future prospects of OpenAI, a startup that is already investing in other AI ventures. Latest reports, published by news agency Reuters, claim that the company was part of a funding round for Physical Intelligence, a startup that is developing foundational software for robots, earlier this week. The robot startup managed to raise more than $400 million in funding through the round. This valued the firm at more than $2 billion. Jeff Bezos and venture capital firms like Thrive Capital and Lux Capital were also part of the funding round. Research by venture capital firm Accel suggests that funding of AI and cloud companies in the US, Europe, and Israel is estimated to hit $79.2 billion by the end of 2024.

news,2024-11-09 11:00:00,Whats next for nuclear stocks after regulatory pushback?,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-next-for-nuclear-stocks-after-regulatory-pushback-160027265.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nuclear energy stocks have become a favorite of Wall Street this year as the artificial intelligence boom spreads and Big Tech searches for ways to meet its growing power demand. They helped power the S&P 500’s Utilities index (XLU) to all-time highs — the index is on track to outperform the S&P 500's equal-weighted counterpart (^SPXEW) in 7 of the past 10 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And Vistra (VST), a nuclear power company, recently surpassed Nvidia (NVDA) as the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) year to date. Big Tech firms, including Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG), drove the gains, announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in investments in nuclear power names over the course of several weeks. It’s a story the market ran with. Then came a regulatory wrist slap that briefly stopped the nuclear energy rally in its tracks. In a 2-to-1 ruling on Nov. 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected a request from Talen Energy (TLN) to increase the power it could provide Amazon from its Susquehanna power plant, citing concerns about grid reliability and energy affordability. Several nuclear energy stocks, including Talen, Oklo (OKLO), Centrus Energy (LEU), Vistra (VST), and NuScale Power (SMR), tumbled the following Monday. Amazon is expected to petition the decision, according to CFRA analyst Daniel Rich. But for investors, “it certainly is a setback,” Rich said. Rich explained that co-location agreements have become a major focus for the tech industry, as they allow hyperscalers to buy power directly from an existing energy source for their data centers. This enables them to build more data centers at speed and at lower costs. But these agreements may be a sticking point for regulators, which is why Big Tech has pursued other strategies, such as creating new sources of nuclear energy through small modular reactors (SMRs). Though there are currently no SMRs in the United States, companies like Amazon see them as a way to affordably add to the power grid while also meeting the increased energy demands AI requires. ""The order may not represent a long-term risk,"" ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox told Yahoo Finance. ""It’s more that FERC may have punted or didn’t want to set a precedent about co-location until it had firm policy."" Clay Sell, the CEO of nuclear reactor designer X-energy, told Yahoo Finance that “a significant portion of the increased electricity demand in the US for the next 25 years is going to come from AI.” “It could be as high as 10%, 20%,” Sell added. Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk also recently contextualized the amount of power the AI boom is going to require. His data shows that you’d have to add three New York Cities' worth of power to the grid by 2030 to meet the demand that is going to come from artificial intelligence. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) Tech companies see nuclear as a way to meet that demand. That may be one reason why Amazon is not done with co-location, telling Yahoo Finance via email that “we remain committed to continue innovating and advancing carbon-free energy solutions with companies like Talen Energy to power data center operations in the United States and the many technologies supporting our customers and our daily lives.” Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez also rebuffed regulators on his company's earnings call, which came one day after the ruling, saying, ""Co-location in competitive markets remains one of the best ways for the US to quickly build the large data centers that are necessary to lead on AI."" Despite beating on earnings and revenue, Constellation stock (CEG) fell after the company reported third quarter results due to fallout from the Talen news. But CFRA's Rich said Constellation is a stock to watch in nuclear. “I think Constellation is the most buyable dip,"" he said. ""Constellation … is by far and away the largest nuclear operator, more than three times more megawatt capacity than the next competitor. And we think that in our view, nuclear is really one of the best ways to service this type of demand from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, [and Magnificent Seven] names that have large needs for power.” Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance Sign in to access your portfolio",82.65326370795567
news,2024-11-09 09:59:00,NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): A Hot Growth Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporation-nvda-hot-growth-145925776.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Hot Growth Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other hot growth stocks. A month before the election that spelled Donald Trump's victory, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released a report showing a robust labor market with rising wages, a decrease in unemployment, and the addition of 254,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in September, down from 4.2% in August and 4.3% in July. Earlier concerns arose when the unemployment rate increased, leading some economists to worry that the Federal Reserve’s decision not to cut interest rates impacted the labor market. However, the Fed eased those concerns in September by cutting the federal funds rate by half a percentage point. The Fed had initially raised rates aggressively beginning in March 2022 to combat inflation, pausing mid-2023. While inflation has cooled significantly since peaking in June 2022, economists note the high rates continue to impact the economy, especially the housing market. That said, Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed the housing market on September 30, noting that he expects housing inflation to keep easing and that overall economic conditions are conducive to further disinflation. On another note, while September's Consumer and Producer Price Indexes aligned with expectations, signaling that inflation is trending toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target, economists at Goldman believe the Fed may have already reached that goal. The investment bank forecasts that the Commerce Department's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for September will show a 12-month inflation rate of 2.04%. If accurate, this figure would be rounded down to 2%, aligning perfectly with the Fed's long-standing objective. This would come just over two years after inflation surged to a 40-year high, prompting a series of aggressive interest rate hikes. Moreover, the S&P 500 has gained 4% since the Fed's rate initial cut last month, as investors have poured over $20 billion into U.S. stock funds. Both Fundstrat and Goldman raised their year-end stock market forecasts in week 41 of this year, with Goldman predicting an additional 2% rise after the S&P 500 exceeded its previous target. This would cap off an already strong year, with the index up more than 20%. A key driver behind the forecasts for continued stock price growth is the expectation that a broader range of industries will contribute to the market's rise. However, in reality, indexes like the S&P 500 remain largely dependent on investor enthusiasm for tech, particularly in the realm of artificial intelligence. On that note, the bank also pointed to a recovering microchip supply chain, which is expected to lift profits for both chipmakers and tech giants as they develop new AI applications. While historical performance isn’t always a reliable indicator, seasonal trends suggest that Q4 often boosts the broader U.S. markets, partly driven by increased consumer spending during the holiday season. Market analysts also note that growth stocks tend to perform well when global interest rates reverse course. However, Adam Parker, CEO of Trivariate Research, shared in an interview with CNBC that he feels more pessimistic about growth stocks compared to his outlook before August 5 lows, citing the unusual market conditions and a slight dip in corporate earnings growth projections. Moreover, despite high expectations that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve would boost the stock market, this hasn’t materialized as anticipated. Investors seem to be increasingly sensitive to growth concerns amid a global landscape marked by the U.S. presidential election, Middle East instability, and an uncertain Fed rate outlook for next year. While the Fed has hinted at more rate cuts, moving too quickly could jeopardize inflation goals. Regarding this, analysts at Stifel made the following remarks: ""The conclusion … is that if the Fed cuts rates in 2025 absent a recession (two 25's as this year comes to a close do not count) then that would be a mistake, with investors paying the price in latter 2025 / 2026, based on historical precedent."" In terms of making money in the stock market, most investors are naturally drawn to growth stocks. While defensive investments are gaining traction due to global economic slowdown, Andrew Slimmon of Morgan Stanley Investment Management advises against this approach. These sentiments emphasize that high-growth stocks can outperform the market and deliver strong returns even if the stock fluctuates during the short term. Many of these stocks have shown impressive revenue growth and, with key catalysts in place, may continue to outperform. Additionally, hedge funds see the most promising growth stocks as those positioned to benefit from rising consumer purchasing power. As the Fed aims for a soft economic landing, consumer cyclical stocks may gain, bolstered by improved consumer spending. Rate cuts should also support growth and tech stocks, setting the stage for potential gains across these sectors. In that same vein, the average annual return for the 500 largest-cap companies has consistently exceeded 10%, giving investors strong confidence to favor the stock market over more conservative options like bonds or fixed-income securities. Our Methodology In this article, we compiled a list of the top growth stocks with year-to-date gains exceeding 20%. These hot stocks to buy are ranked in ascending order based on hedge fund sentiment, offering a clear view of which growth stocks are most favored by institutional investors. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Year-To-Date Gain as of November 6: 181.03% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to lead in artificial intelligence, driven by the high demand for its graphic processing units (GPUs), which are essential for powering AI models. The company offers cutting-edge computing and networking solutions, with its GPUs seeing strong demand in both gaming and AI applications, solidifying NVIDIA as a favorite on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs raised its price target for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $150 from $135 per share in a note on October 11, reflecting an 11% potential upside. The bank highlighted NVIDIA's competitive edge, which is built on factors like its large installed base, continuous innovation at both the chip and data center levels, and a growing portfolio of software solutions, including NVIDIA Parabricks for genomics analysis and NVIDIA AI Aerial for cloud-native 5G networks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares surged to a record high on November 7, making it the first company to reach a $3.6 trillion market valuation as Wall Street’s rally continued, buoyed by Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Moreover, the company has led the U.S. stock market in gains amid an intense competition among Microsoft, Alphabet, and other major players to expand their AI computing power and capture leadership in this fast-growing sector, with its stock having risen more than 206% year-to-date. Vltava Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Over the summer, we devoted a lot of time to studying the AI-related investment wave. This spans a wide range of sectors and our view could be very briefly summarised as follows: The first-tier beneficiaries are primarily companies in the semiconductor sector, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) perhaps the most. That company is benefiting from the huge increase in investment by large technology companies to build enormous data centres. We know who NVIDIA’s customers are. They are companies like Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. They are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into their AI capabilities. What is not entirely clear, however, is who are and will be the customers of NVIDIA’s customers, and, more importantly, when, and if, they will be able to come up with such huge demand for AI services that the profits from AI will justify and pay for the enormous investments all these companies have been making. The further we move away from the starting point that NVIDIA represents in our more broadly-reaching estimates, the lessreliable those estimates are.So far, we know just one thing for sure, and that is that investments in AI capabilities are ongoing and they are huge. They are not only bringing large demand to chipmakers and the semiconductor sector but to some other sectors as well. Indeed, building AI clusters also requires the construction of new semiconductor factories, new energy sources, and all the associated infrastructure. The numbers under consideration are incredibly high. It is possible that over the next decade the construction of AI centres will necessitate a 20% increase in US energy consumption. The investment required will be measured not in the hundreds of billions of dollars, but in an order of magnitude higher. Maybe two orders of magnitude.” Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the hot growth stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other trending AI stocks. The extent to which AI tech may disrupt life as we know it in the coming years is still shrouded in mystery. However, multiple organizations have been making an effort to quantize these changes for a better understanding of the evolving business landscape. For example, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a London-based non-profit group, recently released a report detailing that AI may displace between 1 million to 3 million private sector jobs in the United Kingdom alone in the coming years. However, the report also stressed that the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands as growth in technology also creates new roles. Estimates from the non-profit suggest that at the peak of AI-led disruption, between 60,000 and 275,000 jobs will be displaced every year over a couple of decades. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. This number was put into larger context by the institute by highlighting that the average number of job losses in the European country over the past decade had been 450,000 a year. The AI-led disruption seems modest compared to these figures, per the report.  The report further underlined that a common lesson was that AI was likely to increase the dynamism of the labor market by prompting more workers to leave existing jobs and start new ones. The institute noted that administrative and secretarial jobs would be the most exposed to the new technology, followed by sales and customer service, and banking and finance. The think tank research further claimed that deployment of AI could raise GDP by up to 1% over the next five years, rising to up to 6% by 2035.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179  NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 5, news publication Financial Times reported that large financial institutions on Wall Street had loaned more than $11 billion to a niche group of tech firms due to the fact that these firms possessed AI chips made by NVIDIA. These chips are crucial for AI firms that want to develop and train their own AI models. Per the report, firms that provide cloud computing to AI firms are the recipient of this funding, provided by groups like Blackstone, Pimco, Carlyle, and BlackRock, among others.

news,2024-11-08 14:05:00,Silicon Valley venture capitalists react to Trump's victory: 'Buckle up',Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-valley-venture-capitalists-react-to-trumps-victory-buckle-up-190535478.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Silicon Valley venture capitalists who donated hundreds of millions to Trump are bracing for a sea change in tech. ""I think there's going to be a renaissance of innovation in America and we're going to do more in four years than we've done the last 40 years,"" Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist, told Yahoo Finance. ""So buckle up. It's gonna be pretty, pretty exciting to see."" In June, Pishevar co-hosted a Trump fundraiser at the home of entrepreneur, podcaster, and investor David Sacks that raised $12 million in one day. Trump's reelection ticket was also bankrolled by Silicon Valley heavyweights like Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel. Prior to politics, the vice president-elect, Ohio Senator JD Vance, also had a short stint in VC and has close ties to Thiel. Vice President Kamala Harris, who rose to political prominence in the Bay Area, had the backing of nearly 900 venture capitalists in a movement dubbed ""VCs for Kamala."" Supporters included Mark Cuban, Vinod Khosla, Ron Conway, and Reid Hoffman. Still, that wasn't enough. ""I think it's really important to highlight that there is an internal conversation happening in Silicon Valley,"" Stephen DeBerry, VC and Harris supporter, said. ""Who are we building for? My proposed answer to that question is simple: It's everyone. Because we have the capacity to do that. We can do that, and that's what great nations do. If we answer that question the wrong way and build for some, but not all, I fear for the future of this country."" Most investors and founders Yahoo Finance spoke to expect Trump 2.0 to help clear regulatory hurdles, making it easier to innovate and sell their companies. Some said their frustrations with Democratic policies boiled down to higher taxes, overregulation, and antitrust laws. ""The tech ecosystem is going to grow really fast — much faster than the last four years,"" Pishevar said. ""It's been stalled the last four years. VC's have had difficulty raising capital and I think things are going to change. We're really excited about those changes."" Among Trump's early agenda may be to undo President Biden's executive order on AI. He also said he plans to install a sweeping tariff policy: 10%-20% on all imports, and an additional 60%-100% on Chinese goods. ""I was in a board meeting today and one of my companies uses raw products that come from China — paper products that are printed there,"" DeBerry said. ""So we feel like we are immediately subject to some kind of impact due to tariffs. That is going to flow through to pressure on consumers, unfortunately."" Despite the fears by some, Wall Street has rallied hard this week following Trump's victory. The gains have been led by big-cap tech names such as Nvidia (NVDA). ""The markets are a signal of what's coming,"" Pishevar said. ""I think we're going to have an economic boom, we'll control inflation, create a lot of jobs."" Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who also owns X (formerly known as Twitter), SpaceX, Neuralink, and generative AI startup xAI, has donated more than $130 million to the Trump campaign. Following the win, his net worth rose by more than $20 billion as shares of Tesla jumped nearly 15% on Wednesday. In his victory speech, Trump praised Musk as a ""new star"" and ""super genius."" “We have to protect our super geniuses,” Trump told the crowd on election night. While Trump and Musk have so far dismissed the idea that Musk would hold an official government position, it's speculated that Musk will be an influential adviser. ""I think America needs to be run like a startup,"" Pishevar said about Musk's role. ""And Elon is the best entrepreneur that we've ever had."" Musk has championed the idea of helming a ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE). ""We're going to get the government off your back and out of your pocketbook,"" Musk said at a Trump rally in New York City last month. He added he could slash at least $2 trillion from the US budget. According to the Treasury Department, the federal government spent $6.75 trillion in fiscal year 2024. While Trump didn't say much about AI during his campaign, a second presidency could mean a shakeup in the AI leaderboard. ""AI is going to accelerate so fast we're going to reach AGI or super intelligence within the next two to three years,"" Pishevar said. ""I think there will be Manhattan projects for AI, quantum computing, biotech."" Musk's xAI would benefit from light-touch legislation, though Musk has been a supporter of some AI regulation, including California's controversial AI bill that was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom. While Silicon Valley remains split on its tech vision for the Trump presidency, DeBerry said it's not about politics. ""If we can come to a consensus that we actually care about building a great society, then I'm excited in that context,"" DeBerry said. ""So the question isn't about technology. The question isn't about economic capability. The question is about our will."" Yasmin Khorram is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has officially joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), cementing the tech giant's significance in the artificial intelligence era. Despite a broader dip in chip stocks Friday, Nvidia notched a weekly gain of roughly 9%. That surge has helped it overtake Apple (AAPL) this week as the world’s most valuable company, with its $3.6 trillion market cap ahead of Apple’s $3.4 trillion as of Friday at market close. “A lot of us on Wall Street talk about the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC). But really most of America knows the Dow,” said Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox in an interview with Yahoo Finance Friday, “So a lot of America is going to be introduced or at least have to get a little bit more familiar with Nvidia, and all of what Nvidia means in this AI story.” The AI chip market is set to grow 99% in 2024 and another 74% next year, according to consulting firm International Business Strategies, which tracks industry data. Nvidia has repeatedly disproven fears of a so-called AI bubble and shows no signs of a slowdown. CEO Jensen Huang has touted “insane” demand for the company's chips. Some 90% of analysts recommend buying Nvidia stock and see shares hitting $149.38 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Shares stood at $147.36 Friday. Meanwhile, the former tech darling Intel (INTC), which Nvidia replaced in the Dow, has fallen nearly 50% since the beginning of 2024 as investors grow wary of its ongoing production issues and gloomy financials and question whether its turnaround plan will succeed. In Trump's second term, Nvidia, like the rest of the AI chip market, could face hurdles in the form of high tariffs on Chinese goods and heightened trade tensions. The president-elect has suggested imposing 10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on imports from China — levels unseen since the Great Depression. Nvidia manufactures its chips in Taiwan with TSMC (TSMC34.SA), which uses components from China to make those chips. ""Trump's victory brings further uncertainty to the semiconductor sector in terms of its impact on additional China restrictions, higher tariffs, and CHIPS Act funding,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note Friday. “Disruptions to the global supply chain would be a problem for NVIDIA because they'd be a problem for TSMC,” D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an interview this week. The chipmaker is set to report quarterly earnings on Nov. 20. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazon (AMZN, Financials) is considering a significant additional investment in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic, according to a report by The Information. Comprising several billion dollars, this possible investment would match Amazon's original $4 billion pledge to Anthropic. The new arrangement could call for Anthropic to make use of recently launched November 2023 Amazon AI processors, Graviton4 and Trainium2. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. Traditionally, anthropic has depended on Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) processors; Nvidia has an estimated 70% of the market for AI accelerators. According to reports in October 2024, Anthropic was in negotiations to raise further money at a value of about $40 billion. Supported by Microsoft (MSFT, Financials), OpenAI attracted $6.6 billion in investment and valued the business at $157 billion, ranking second most valuable startup worldwide. Relatedly, Amazon Web Services has been extending its artificial intelligence capacity from its cloud computing segment. Aiming to improve its AI infrastructure and lower dependency on other vendors, AWS revealed in September 2024 a strategic cooperation with Intel (INTC, Financials) to build proprietary AI processors. This action complements Amazon's larger plan to maintain its leadership in the artificial intelligence market and provide its consumers more reasonably priced options. Nvidia keeps leading the AI chip market meanwhile as its GPUs are extensively used for artificial intelligence training and inference chores. The business has been concentrating on creating increasingly sophisticated processors to satisfy the rising market for artificial intelligence uses. Indicating a greater need for sophisticated, energy-efficient processors vital for AI technology, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, asked SK Hynix to accelerate the production of its HBM4 high-bandwidth memory chips by six months in November 2024. Significantly investing in OpenAI, Microsoft has been implementing OpenAI's ideas into its goods and services. Microsoft and OpenAI were debating in October about how Microsoft's $14 billion investment would turn into stock when OpenAI moves into a for-profit company. This change is likely to affect the dynamics of the AI sector as well as the alliances among its companies. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.
