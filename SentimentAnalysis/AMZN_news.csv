The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has steadily expanded from selling books to nearly everything imaginable. Early investors have gotten the best end of the stick here, but the gains are clearly far from over. Peter Lynch categorizes three main types of companies/stocks (out of his complete classification of 6 types): Fast Growers Slow Growers Stalwarts Amazon is a stalwart, but I think the recent spike has proven that it's worth looking deeper into. Many of its segments have fast-grower characteristics—the cloud segment, for example—and how these perform is important because they could make the stock swing significantly in either direction in the future. Let's see if Amazon is worth buying right now; if it is, is the upside worth it? You probably know more than enough about Amazon, but I believe it is worth refreshing your idea on what this company does. The best way to do this is to break down how this company makes its money segment by segment. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has basically become the bread and butter of Amazon. It is by far the most important segment here. Without AWS pushing up the growth figures, investors would not be willing to pay 42 times earnings for Amazon. The cloud computing platform has huge room to grow—or is at least assumed to—in the coming years as the internet as a whole expands and AI models demand more data. AWS is the engine behind so many platforms and companies that discussing them would be out of the scope of this article. Amazon's advertising segment has also been a significant growth driver. It achieved 19% YOY growth in Q3 2024. The segment generated $14.3 billion in revenue. Nonetheless, we're going to look at the most important element: AI. AWS's dominance in AI infrastructure is particularly noteworthy because it is growing at a triple-digit pace. Amazon's current CEO Jassy noted that the company's “...AI business is a multi-billion dollar business that’s growing triple-digit percentages year-over-year, and it’s growing three times faster at this stage of evolution than AWS.” Moreover, custom semiconductor investments—including Trainium and Inferentia chips—reduce dependency on external suppliers like Nvidia and enhance profit margins. There's a lot more room for bottom-line growth here as Amazon starts to shave down costs by using its own chips and not paying Nvidia's—frankly—insane markups. The stock is going to follow these bottom-line advances higher, but that'll only be possible as long as the top line keeps growing and if estimates are right. AWS is going to make or break Amazon's reputation as a growth investment, so it's worth looking closely into. AWS' growth could slow down if the broader AI and cloud computing industries do. Meanwhile, Amazon has been investing aggressively to capture the market share as the AI/cloud market balloons. Projected capital expenditure is at $75 billion for 2024, with a significant portion dedicated to AWS infrastructure and AI. CEO Andy Jassy indicated that 2025 capital spending will likely exceed the 2024 figure; he views it as a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."" There has also been heavy investment in data center expansion and custom chip development—including Graviton4-based compute instances—which offer 30% better price performance. There's good reason to believe that this sort of aggressive funding will keep AWS growth high as long as there's demand. The combination of AWS and advertising segments is expected to reach a $160 billion annualized run rate by the end of 2024 and represent ~25% of Amazon's total revenue. CEO Andy Jassy suggested that ""the rate of growth has a chance to improve over time as we have bigger and bigger capacity."" It's very hard to judge how much the rate of growth will improve. Management will obviously try to make things look better than they are. It is possible that the rate of growth remains flat or even declines a little. The sales growth acceleration has been nearly flat so far at 0.4 percentage points compared to the previous quarter. The total cloud market is expected to grow from $676.29 billion in 2024 to $2,291.59 billion by 2032. That leaves AWS with a lot of room for growth, even from where it is currently. The market has a projected CAGR of 16.5% during the forecast period. If this forecast is right—which is unlikely, given the track record of such forecasts—AMZN stock is a hand-over-fist buy. I'm not confident AWS can keep up such a growth rate for over a decade. Plus, competitors of AWS are growing faster—at least in percentage terms. Microsoft's Azure grew by 33% and Google Cloud saw 35% growth. That's well over AWS' 19.1% YOY growth in Q3. But again, keep in mind that AWS has a market share of around 31% compared to Azure's 20% and Google Cloud's 11%. The bigger size of Amazon Web Services can make it look more sluggish than it really is. AWS' 19.1% YOY growth—in linear terms, or as in raw numbers—is still higher than Azure and Google Cloud's growth. Even then, AWS has lost market share. Not by a substantial margin, but Amazon’s market share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market of 31% in Q3 2024 is a 1% decline from the previous quarter. All that makes me believe that AWS is unlikely to see any huge swings in either direction on its own. The only way I see this segment perform badly is if the broader AI and cloud industry struggles. In this case, Amazon would not be the only company underperforming. Most big software companies are betting big on cloud and AI, too. AMZN is among the stocks that seem permanently overvalued due to its high PE. A similar company I could think of would be Tesla. Wall Street is willing to pay more due to the long-term growth prospects these businesses have. There's good reason to believe that the premium for Amazon will hold up. Even if AWS doesn't keep up, Amazon's e-commerce business—something we haven't even scraped the surface of in this column—has a massive moat. There are competitors from China, but I really do not think these competitors are a long-term threat to Amazon. Shein and Temu are not going to conquer the US e-commerce market due to tariffs. A possible Trump presidency would accelerate that process exponentially. There's no denying that e-commerce is the future in terms of how people shop. A lot is going on in the background with automation and drone deliveries. No one is close to Amazon—especially in the US—in the e-commerce department, so this is worth keeping in mind when valuing Amazon. Regardless, let's evaluate Amazon. My take based on everything we've discussed so far—and Morningstar's fair value estimate—is that AMZN stock is ever-so-slightly undervalued. I do have several scenarios of how the investment could turn out. Big stalwarts like Amazon move in tune with the rest of the market, so the macros are really going to decide how Amazon performs at the end of the day. The stock's recent rally nearing the $200 level is particularly significant from a technical perspective. This price point has been a strong resistance level since July 2023; significant insider activity was seen back then. The current momentum—supported by strong fundamentals—suggests a potential for a breakthrough above this level. Amazon has received overwhelming support from Wall Street analysts, with 92 Buy ratings and only 3 Hold ratings. The consensus is strongly bullish, with multiple analysts raising their price targets following Amazon's Q3 results. Here are the scenarios I believe could unfold in the coming twelve months based on my research and what these analysts think: Current estimates expect revenue growth at 10.9% this year and 10.8% next year. EPS is projected to grow 75.6% this year and 18.7% next year, and operating income is forecast to grow at a 38% CAGR over the next three years. You're paying 42 times trailing (34x forward) earnings for this. You're also paying 3.4 times sales. Amazon is a hybrid company, so it's hard to compare these valuations against just one industry. But if we look at the broader software industry (where you can find the steepest valuations), Wall Street pays 26 times trailing earnings and 22 times forward earnings—out of 1556 companies—for the median software company. AMZN stock is overvalued in this sense, but again, I believe taking Wall Street's long-term perception of this business makes it more than investable if you are holding it for the long term. These valuations have also trended down with growth metrics, so I have no reason to believe that the market is being overly generous or unrealistic about AMZN stock. Amazon certainly isn't the bargain it once was for early investors, but I still believe the stock remains a worthwhile long-term investment at its current price. AWS continues to drive massive growth and remains the linchpin of the overall business. As long as cloud adoption and AI development continue their explosive growth trajectories, AWS is poised to ride that tailwind for many years to come. Even if AWS's growth slows modestly, Amazon's core e-commerce operations have tremendous staying power and are almost impossible for any competitor to displace in the near future. With the stock still projected to grow earnings at a healthy clip over the next few years, I don't believe the current valuation fully accounts for Amazon's future potential. Some near-term volatility is possible as macroeconomic concerns linger. However, Amazon has shown an impressive ability to execute over the long run. For patient investors with a minimum 3-5-year horizon, I believe Amazon remains a core holding for beating the market; double-digit annual returns still seem achievable. Thus, I'd rate it a buy; YMMV. While I acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an AI play, my conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

news,2024-11-02 09:00:00,The Latest Magnificent Seven Stocks to Report Earnings   Are They Buys?,InvestorPlace,https://investorplace.com/market360/2024/11/the-latest-magnificent-seven-stocks-to-report-earnings-are-they-buys/," 
			The latest earnings reports should tell us more…		 Source: OpenAI Wall Street has started off November in a better mood after a couple of October “spooks” they got yesterday. Yesterday, the S&P 500 went up 0.4%, the Dow rose 0.7% and the NASDAQ gapped up 0.8%. The main culprit was the earnings results from a couple of “Magnificent Seven” companies that investors were laser-focused on this earnings season: Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). Their results sparked concerns over their aggressive increase in AI spending. (You can read my full review of those earnings here.) So, the question for investors now is who is the true king of “The Magnificent Seven”? NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is, of course, the red-hot company right now. With a market cap of $3.3 trillion, it’s the second-largest company in the S&P 500. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) edges NVDA out for the top spot. We’ll learn more from NVIDIA on November 21, when the company announces its results. But for now, it was Apple’s and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN) turn to release their earnings this week. Investors have been eager to see whether Apple’s entry into the AI race will bear any fruit. And given the concerns about AI spending, investors were curious to see whether Amazon is bucking the trend.  So, in today’s Market 360, I’ll review the latest earnings from Apple and Amazon. We’ll examine whether investors got what they were hoping for, and I’ll also share whether my Stock Grader system says they’re good buys right now. Then, I’ll share where you can learn about my latest election prediction which could shock you. For its third quarter, Amazon reported results that blew expectations out of the water. The company reported $1.43 earnings per share on $158.9 billion in revenue. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $1.16 on $157.29 billion in revenue, so Amazon posted an impressive 23% earnings surprise. Now, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon’s cloud computing unit, and Wall Street closely tracks it because it has been a huge driver of both sales and profit for the company. For the quarter, AWS raked in $27.45 billion in revenue which was about in line with Wall Street expectations. In other words, Amazon remains more dominant than ever in cloud computing. The company recently launched new AI-powered features, including Rufus, a generative AI-powered shopping assistant, which is available in parts of Europe. Then, there’s Project Amelia, an AI assistant that helps sellers with tailored business insights. During Amazon’s earnings call on Thursday evening, CEO Andy Jassy explained that Amazon expects to spend more than $75 billion in 2024, and even more next year. And this is all due to, you guessed it, the demand for generative AI and the data centers needed to fuel it. Here’s what he had to say: The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware. And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all that up front, in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources. Now, I want to highlight one key thing about Amazon, which is that it seems to be benefitting from its AI investments already. Unlike Microsoft, which said it expects slower growth in its cloud business, Andy Jassy said that the AI business within AWS has generated several billion in sales already and that it is growing at a triple-digit rate. And this is why Amazon’s shares went up by about 6% on Friday following the earnings beat. Apple also beat Wall Street’s expectations but was hit hard by a large tax payment to the European Union (EU). For its fourth quarter, Apple reported $1.64 earnings per share on revenue of $94.9 billion in revenue. Analysts were expecting $1.60 earnings per share on $94.58 billion in revenue. There was just one problem. Apple had to make a hefty one-time payment of $10.2 billion in back taxes to Ireland after the European Court of Justice ruled that Apple benefited from Ireland’s tax loopholes. Despite this charge, Apple is seeing strong growth in iPhone sales, which account for 49% of the company’s overall sales. iPhone revenue reached $46.2 billion, which is a 6% growth from the same quarter last year. In the Greater China region, however, revenue was down year-over-year to $15.03 billion – and this disappointed some investors. In my opinion, CEO Tim Cook is growing weary of China’s troubles weighing on Apple’s bottom line. And this is one reason why the company is pivoting its focus to India. I should also add that the new Apple Intelligence features became available in the U.S. for iPhone, iPad and iMac users earlier this week. CEO Tim Cook says it “marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation.” However, like all the Magnificent Seven stocks, investors want to see that the company’s AI spending is going to lead to growing revenue and profits soon.   Apple did project company revenue to grow “low- to mid-single digits” year-over-year next quarter. And that disappointed Wall Street, sending Apple’s stock down about 1.3% yesterday. Clearly, investors were pleased with Amazon’s results. And while investors were not as happy with Apple’s earnings, I think Apple is doing a much better job monetizing AI right now than, say, Microsoft.   Of course, this may already be baked into the cake, considering the $300 billion disparity between Apple and Microsoft’s market caps. However, it’s important to remember that the AI race is a marathon and not a sprint. And since Apple typically enters the fray late and comes from behind, I wouldn’t count the company out. But the proof is in the pudding, as they say. So, let’s see what my Stock Grader (subscription required) has to say… Apple gets a C-rating for both the Fundamental and Quantitative Grades. It also has a Total Grade of “C”, which signifies a “Hold.” In other words, if you’re looking to buy, you may want to hold off until the fundamentals and buying pressure improve. But if you own it, I wouldn’t sell it just yet. Amazon, meanwhile, has stronger fundamentals, marked by the Fundamental Grade of “B.” However, buying pressure has dried up a bit, which is why it has a Quantitative Grade of “D.” The Quantitative Grade makes up 70% of the Total Grade, so the end result is a Total Grade of “C” for Amazon. So, it’s not a buy just yet, either. This upcoming Tuesday, November 5, everyone will be making their way to the polls to cast their ballot for the next President of the United States. But the real story is what could happen the day after the election, on November 6. In short, I’m talking about the potential for political strife to cause the markets to shift at an unparalleled, chaotic rate. Now, you’re probably thinking that you should move your money around, right? Before you do, I want you to know that in my four decades of experience in the market, I can tell you that times of chaos are often the best opportunities for life-changing profits.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazon's robust financial performance with net income rising from $9.879 billion in Q3 2023 to $15.328 billion in Q3 2024. Continued expansion in net sales, with a notable increase from $143.083 billion in Q3 2023 to $158.877 billion in Q3 2024. Strategic investments in technology and infrastructure to support growth across diverse segments. Challenges in international taxation and competitive pressures in various market segments. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the global leader in online retail and cloud computing services, has released its 10-Q filing on November 1, 2024, offering a detailed glimpse into its financial performance and operational strategies. The company continues to dominate with a diverse portfolio that includes retail sales, Amazon Web Services (AWS), advertising services, and international operations. The financial overview from the recent filing indicates a robust increase in net income, from $9.879 billion in Q3 2023 to $15.328 billion in Q3 2024, and a significant rise in total net sales from $143.083 billion to $158.877 billion for the same period. This financial strength underpins Amazon's strategic initiatives and investments in technology and infrastructure, positioning it well for sustained growth and innovation. Market Leadership and Brand Value: Amazon's brand is synonymous with online retail, boasting a vast customer base and unparalleled market reach. The company's net sales have shown a consistent upward trajectory, with a notable increase from $143.083 billion in Q3 2023 to $158.877 billion in Q3 2024. This growth is a testament to Amazon's strong brand equity and its ability to attract and retain customers. The brand's value is further reinforced by its diversified business model, which includes retail, AWS, and advertising services, each contributing to a robust revenue stream and providing a hedge against market volatility. Technological Innovation: Amazon's commitment to innovation is evident in its strategic investments in technology and infrastructure, which are crucial for maintaining its competitive edge. The company's technology and infrastructure costs reflect significant investments in AWS and other Amazon businesses, ensuring a wide variety of products and services for customers. These investments are not only geared towards current needs but also lay the groundwork for future growth areas such as global broadband services and autonomous vehicles. Financial Health: Amazon's financial health remains strong, with a substantial increase in net income from $9.879 billion in Q3 2023 to $15.328 billion in Q3 2024. The company's ability to generate higher earnings and maintain a solid balance sheet provides it with the financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities, invest in new technologies, and navigate economic uncertainties. International Tax Challenges: Amazon faces ongoing tax disputes in multiple jurisdictions, including the U.S., China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. These disputes could lead to significant tax liabilities and impact the company's financial results. For instance, the Luxembourg tax authority's denial of the tax basis for certain intangible assets could result in substantial tax payments, although Amazon intends to defend its position vigorously. Dependency on North American Markets: While Amazon has a global presence, its financials reveal a heavy reliance on North American markets, which could expose the company to regional economic downturns or market saturation. Diversifying its revenue streams and reducing dependency on any single market is crucial for long-term stability and growth. Competitive Pressures: Amazon operates in highly competitive markets, facing challenges from established retailers, emerging e-commerce platforms, and other tech giants. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its market position, which requires significant investments and may pressure profit margins. Expansion of AWS and Cloud Services: AWS continues to be a significant growth driver for Amazon, with increasing demand for cloud services across various industries. The company's ongoing investments in infrastructure and technology position AWS to capture a larger market share in the rapidly expanding cloud computing sector. Growth in Emerging Markets: Amazon has the opportunity to expand its retail and AWS operations in emerging markets, where e-commerce and cloud adoption are growing. By tailoring its offerings to local needs and navigating regulatory environments, Amazon can tap into new customer segments and drive international growth. Advancements in AI and Machine Learning: Amazon's expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning presents opportunities for product innovation and service enhancement. These technologies can improve customer experiences, streamline operations, and create new revenue streams through advanced analytics and automation. Regulatory and Legal Risks: Amazon faces regulatory scrutiny in various markets, which could result in restrictions, fines, or changes to its business practices. The evolving regulatory landscape, particularly concerning data privacy, antitrust, and labor laws, poses a threat to Amazon's operational freedom and profitability. Global Economic Uncertainties: Macroeconomic factors such as inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical developments can impact consumer spending and Amazon's cost structure. The company must navigate these uncertainties while maintaining its growth trajectory and managing expenses. Supply Chain Disruptions: Amazon's vast logistics network is susceptible to disruptions from global events, such as pandemics or trade conflicts. Ensuring supply chain resilience is critical to avoid interruptions in service and maintain customer satisfaction. In conclusion, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) exhibits formidable strengths, including market leadership, technological prowess, and financial robustness, which are foundational to its success.

He is an expert at elucidating complex financial topics in clear, concise language. Michael received a Bachelor of Arts in literature from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a master's in linguistics from the Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia. Michael M. Santiago / Staff / Getty Images  Following a pair of negative trading sessions, major U.S. equities indexes closed out the week on a strong note, pushing higher on Friday as investors cheered upbeat earnings results from e-commerce and cloud computing behemoth Amazon (AMZN).
  The S&P 500 added 0.4% to wrap up the trading week and kick off November. The Dow and the Nasdaq were up 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively.
  Shares of Waters Corp. (WAT), a provider of analytical laboratory instruments and software, surged 19.8% on Friday to a 52-week high, delivering the top daily performance in the S&P 500. The gains for Waters stock came after the life, materials, food, and environmental sciences supplier reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and earnings per share (EPS).
  Cable TV, mobile, and internet service provider Charter Communications (CHTR) also topped sales and profit estimates with its third-quarter results, and its shares jumped 11.9%. The company posted a solid increase in mobile customers, and although Charter lost subscribers to its internet and video services, declines in those areas were less significant than analysts anticipated. Despite Friday's rally, Charter shares remain in negative territory for 2024.
  Although semiconductor giant Intel (INTC) posted a third-quarter loss, reflecting the impact of impairment and restructuring charges, its sales for the period came in ahead of forecasts, and its shares gained 7.8%. Intel also struck a positive tone regarding the future of its server and PC businesses, issuing better-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter. The company has benefitted from an uptick in PC demand driven by the launch of on-device AI features.
  Super Micro Computer (SMCI) shares dropped 10.5%, the heaviest loss of any S&P 500 constituent. Friday's plunge extended steep losses posted by the stock earlier this week as accounting firm EY resigned from its role as auditor for the server and data storage company. Questions about Supermicro's accounting practices came to the forefront over the summer when short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report alleging manipulation by the company.
  Power generation company AES Corp. (AES) reported better-than-expected profits for the third quarter, boosted by increased utilities and renewables earnings, but its shares sank 9.9%. Although companies like AES are expected to benefit from increased power demand from AI data centers, the Virginia-based firm posted a year-over-year decline in revenue, dragged down by lower sales from its energy infrastructure unit.
  Amcor (AMCR) shares slipped 7.8% after the packaging provider missed quarterly sales estimates. Soft consumer demand weighed on Amcor's sales of cartons and containers to consumer goods companies. Destocking in health care packaging represents another headwind for the company. Amcor also announced that it would sell its 50% stake in Bericap North America, a joint venture focused on plastic closures for various packaging applications.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazon (AMZN) stock closed 6% higher on Friday after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected. The company said on Thursday that it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecast $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said operating income is expected to be between $16 billion and $20 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall Street had projected $17.49 billion. In the third quarter, Amazon posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Meanwhile, Amazon's closely tracked Amazon Web Services unit tallied revenue of $27.45 billion in the quarter, roughly in line with Wall Street's projections. ""You've got the ingredients you needed for the stock to go up,"" Arun Sundaram, CFRA senior equity research analyst, told Yahoo Finance. Sundaram pointed to Amazon's 11% operating margin, which came in above Wall Street's expectations of 9.34%, as another key driver of the stock's move higher after hours. Arun noted that Amazon is able to pull on other levers in its business, like its e-commerce unit or advertising, to help grow margins while it spends on AI. Amazon's earnings follow a volatile few trading sessions for Big Tech companies amid other earnings reports as artificial intelligence spending and how each company is managing it has been in particular focus. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines and posted impressive gains in its cloud and advertising segments, business lines that compete with Amazon. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Meta (META) had a tougher going. The stocks of both tech giants fell after their earnings Thursday, as investors were spooked by an increase in AI spending, despite both companies beating expectations after the bell on Wednesday. Meta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth in 2025. On Thursday night, Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and CEO Andy Jassy said the company expects to spend ""more than that"" in 2025. In 2023, Amazon's capital expenditures were $48.4 billion. Jassy said the increased spending is driven by generative AI, which he described as a ""maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity."" ""The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital in data centers and networking gear and hardware,"" Jassy said on the earnings call when explaining why spending continues to grow. ""And of course, in the hardware of AI, the accelerators or the chips are more expensive than the CPU hardware. And so we invest in all that up front, in advance of when we can monetize it with customers using the resources."" Jassy added, ""I think, as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space."" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

news,2024-11-01 14:34:00,What We Learned About AI From This Week's Big Tech Earnings,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/what-we-learned-about-ai-from-big-tech-earnings-8738426,"Colin is an Associate Editor focused on tech and financial news. He has more than three years of experience editing, proofreading, and fact-checking content on current financial events and politics. He received his M.A. in journalism from The New School and his B.A. in history and political science from McGill University. Investopedia / Alice Morgan / Getty Images  Big Tech's AI boom is still on.
  Artificial intelligence was the focus of the five tech giants, cumulatively valued at more than $10 trillion, that reported quarterly earnings this week. Executives at Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) touted the progress their companies have made incorporating AI into their operations and rolling out new AI features for customers. They also spoke to the strength of AI demand—and the challenges they've met trying to meet it.
  Investors now turn their attention to the last of the Magnificent Seven companies to report: Nvidia (NVDA), whose results are due Nov. 20. Its stock surged to a record high last month as investors anticipated that this week’s earnings would contain evidence of booming demand for its AI chips.
  Big Tech’s spending on infrastructure has skyrocketed this year. Cloud providers have raced to build out their AI operations and meet surging demand for cloud computing. 
  Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta spent a cumulative $60 billion on property and equipment in the third quarter, a 60% increase from the same period last year, according to an Investopedia analysis. All four indicated that infrastructure investments would continue to increase next year. 
  Surging infrastructure expenses hung over tech giants during their last round of earnings reports in July, when Wall Street was antsy to see evidence that investments were paying off. Those fears seem to have abated somewhat with this week’s reports.
  A common refrain from tech executives this week was that they can’t keep up with demand. 
  Microsoft on Wednesday warned that growth at its cloud unit could slow in its second fiscal quarter. AI demand “continues to be higher than our available capacity,” according to CFO Amy Hood.
  Her comments were echoed by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday, who said Amazon Web Services was also having difficulty meeting cloud computing demand.
  A shortage of the most advanced semiconductors, Jassy said, was the main bottleneck.
  Despite capacity constraints, AI is still driving growth for tech giants.
  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company’s AI business was on track to reach an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion in the current quarter, making it “the fastest business in our history to reach this milestone.” Jassy on Thursday said Amazon’s AI business is growing by triple-digit percentages, three times faster than cloud computing grew in its early stages. 
  Alphabet executives said they expected AI investments to “translate to revenue in the fairly short term.” AI Overviews in Google search were being monetized at “approximately the same rate” as older formats, he said, boosting confidence that AI can boost Alphabet’s core ad business as well as its cloud unit.
  Meta also touted the benefits it’s seeing from AI. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said AI-driven feed recommendations had increased the time users spent on Facebook and Instagram this year, and that businesses using Meta’s generative AI advertising tools had seen an increase in conversions.
  Apple reported record September-quarter iPhone and total revenue on Thursday. CEO Tim Cook noted on a call with analysts that iPhone users were adopting Apple's newest operating system, the Apple Intelligence-enabled iOS 18.1, at twice the rate of its predecessor, which the firm took as an early indication of strong demand for its custom AI.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of cloud computing and online retail behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jumped 7.6% in the morning session after the company reported impressive third-quarter earnings. Amazon blew past analysts' EPS and operating income expectations during the quarter, giving credence to the argument that the company can be much more profitable and high margin going forward. Operating profit guidance for next quarter also came in ahead. Taking a closer look at the operating segments, AWS (Amazon Web Services), grew 19% year on year, in line with analysts' estimates, while operating margin beat handily. Notably, AWS reached a revenue run rate of $110 billion amid growing demand for cloud and AI services. Advertising revenue, which is a promising growth driver, also exceeded Wall Street's expectations. AMZN noted that the advertising business recorded strong margin expansion, helping to make sense of the improvements in profitability recorded in the quarter. It wasn't a perfect quarter, as revenue guidance for the next quarter was underwhelming. Given the excitement around margins, though, the market is overlooking the revenue guidance shortfall. Overall, we think this was a very good quarter showing that there might need to be more bullishness around Amazon's long-term margin structure. Is now the time to buy Amazon? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. Amazon’s shares are very volatile and have had 27 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 25 days ago when the stock dropped 3.1% on the news that Wells Fargo analyst Ken Gawrelski downgraded the stock's rating from Overweight (Buy) to Equal Weight (Hold) and lowered the price target from $225 to $183. The analyst was concerned that the projected gains from AWS (Amazon Web Services - cloud computing business) would likely not be enough to power the profitability narrative. Gawrelski added, ""While the market is more prepared for pressure on 4Q [operating income], we caution that margin expansion could be capped in 1H25 as well."" Amazon is up 32.3% since the beginning of the year, and at $198.43 per share, it is trading close to its 52-week high of $200 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Amazon’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,215. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

news,2024-11-01 14:28:00,Amazon Earnings Illustrate the Power of AI,InvestorPlace,https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2024/11/amazon-earnings-illustrate-the-power-of-ai/," 
			The result is that Amazon can deliver more products at lower prices while cutting expenses and boosting profit margins		 Key Takeaways: Source: QubixStudio / Shutterstock.com The stock market powered higher today to kickstart November on a positive note, driven by a combination of strong earnings and encouraging economic data. Several tech companies delivered good numbers last night, topping estimates and confirming both the resilience of the U.S. economy and strength of the AI Boom. As we’ve been saying for weeks, the fundamental earnings trends underlying the stock market are very positive and highly supportive of continued stock market strength. Last night, tech juggernaut Amazon (AMZN) reported very impressive quarterly numbers which underscored one powerful reality: AI can dramatically improve your business. Just look at what Amazon’s doing. It is using AI across all its major operating businesses to boost revenues and profit margins. On the retail side, Amazon is deploying more robotics to automate fulfillment and unlock operational efficiencies. Its newest 12th generation robotic fulfillment center design, for example, is reducing fulfillment processing time by up to 25%, increasing the number of items it can offer for same-day or next-day delivery. What’s more, it’s expected to drive a 25% improvement in its cost to serve. The result is that Amazon can deliver more products at lower prices (driving accelerated retail revenue growth) while simultaneously cutting expenses and boosting profit margins (driving huge profit margin expansion and even bigger profit growth). Amazon saw both its online and physical retail sales growth rates accelerate in the quarter, while operating margins soared by about 300 basis points year-over-year. On the advertising side, Amazon is rolling out genAI-powered creative tools across display, video, and audio, including a video generator that uses a single product image to curate custom AI-generated videos. This is driving increased engagement with the ad business and sustaining approximately 20% revenue growth in that business even as it grows. Meanwhile, on the cloud side, Amazon Web Services – or AWS – has grown its AI business into a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate business that continues to grow at a triple-digit rate. Indeed, AWS AI is growing more than three times faster at this stage of its evolution than AWS itself grew. The AI cloud business is absolutely surging right now, and that is driving sustained growth rates of around 20% for all of AWS. Across its entire business, Amazon is figuring out how to harness the power of AI to improve its products, launch new products, and unlock operational efficiencies – the sum of which is driving accelerated revenue growth, big profit margin expansion, and huge profit growth. Amazon’s revenue growth rate accelerated higher to 11% this past quarter. Profit margins expanded by almost 300 basis points. And operating profits rose more than 55%… Ultimately, all these financial gains are driving stock market gains for AMZN, too. Amazon’s stock is rallying strongly today and is now up about 45% over the past year. Amazon is not alone here. Its Big Tech peers – including Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) – are also all using AI to improve their business results. Alphabet has improved Google Search with AI Overviews, Meta has improved Facebook and Instagram feeds with AI-powered recommendations, and Microsoft has improved Office 365 with 365 Copilot. AI Overviews are driving increased Google Search usage… AI-powered content algorithms are driving increased time spent on the Facebook and Instagram platforms… And about 70% of Fortune 500 firms have signed up for Office 365 Copilot. Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta are all using AI to improve their existing products, and in response, usage of their existing products is rising strongly. Meanwhile, all three are also using AI to launch new products. Alphabet has created its new AI model, Gemini. According to management, Gemini growth is surging right now. Meta has launched its own Meta AI assistant within its apps. That AI assistant already has 500 million monthly active users. And Microsoft has launched its AI-powered data analytics platform Fabric, which is already being used by more than 70% of the Fortune 500. Meanwhile – like Amazon – Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are also figuring out how to drive operational efficiencies with AI. For example, both Meta and Alphabet reported several hundred basis points of profit-margin expansion this past quarter (same as Amazon). So… Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft are all using AI to improve their existing products, launch new products, and boost profit margins, which is leading to supercharged revenue growth at all three firms and supercharged profit growth, too. Folks, the AI opportunity is confirmed. Sure, a lot of pundits out there are calling AI a bunch of hype and saying this is a bubble. But what Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet reported this week wasn’t hype. It was real revenue growth. It was real usage growth. It was real profit margin expansion. It was real profit growth. It was proof that the AI Boom is real. It was confirmation of the huge AI opportunity. And further confirmation that AI stocks will likely remain the big winners on Wall Street so long as stocks keep pushing higher – which we think they will for the foreseeable future.

The quarterly results this week of Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) provided an AI-era playbook for making investors patiently wait for results on massive infrastructure spending. Alphabet dazzled Wall Street on Tuesday with earnings that beat analysts' estimates on the top and bottom lines, helped by strong growth in its cloud business. The company posted profit and sales increases of 37% and 15%, respectively, compared to the year prior. Even as investors in recent months have expressed some impatience with the tech industry's enormous investments in AI technology, Google showed that a dominant performance of its core business can alleviate those concerns. Amazon, too, offered a resounding earnings beat. The company posted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $158.9 billion. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. The stellar report helped offset lingering concerns about mounting capital expenditures. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call Thursday that ""as the market matures over time, they're going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space."" Amazon said it expects to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2024 and Jassy said the company plans to spend ""more than that"" in 2025. The e-commerce giant's approach to selling AI spending was also helped by claims that new revenue has already arrived. While Amazon has not disclosed exact figures for AI-related sales, Jassy has said the AI business inside of its cloud unit has generated several billion dollars. And on Thursday he added that the business is growing at a ""triple-digit year-over-year percentage.” But investors have not given all the big-spending tech companies the same leeway when it comes to ballooning capital expenditures. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) were met with a more unforgiving investor response this week, even as both tech giants beat Wall Street’s expectations on earnings and revenue. Investors sent both stocks lower after their respective reports. Wall Street recoiled after executives of both companies said they expect capex to continue increasing in the quarters to come. Meta notably said the company expects significant capital expenditure growth next year and revised its expectation upward for 2024 capex. The uneasiness among investors harkens back to Facebook's prior spending spree, when Reality Labs lost more than $13 billion and shares in the company tanked 60% in 2022. Zuckerberg has since improved the company's financials and its standing on Wall Street, but he's also prompted a fresh round of jitters. Microsoft's boosted AI spending came with its own troublesome news: The company said it expects slower growth in its cloud business, highlighting the risks of dedicating major resources to AI development without the returns to offset them. Both Jassy and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have framed their spending on AI as worthwhile endeavors, helping to massage the worries of investing in a new technology with uncertain returns. Earlier this year Pichai addressed Wall Street's fears head on: ""The risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-investing for us here.” In his view, spending too much on AI is a small price to pay for claiming a leadership position in a future AI-dominated landscape. Jassy offered a similar argument on Thursday, describing generative AI as a ""maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity."" Google and Amazon investors appear to be taking them at their word.

news,2024-11-01 14:12:00,Netflix has won the streaming wars  heres how others will compete,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-has-won-the-streaming-wars--heres-how-others-will-compete-181240317.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It's no secret the overall media and entertainment industry has struggled in recent years, burdened by labor strikes, profitability challenges, and a transition to streaming that's upended some of the most well-known corporate behemoths. One company, though, has thrived amid the various changes: Netflix (NFLX). The streaming platform beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs. The stock is up more than 50% since the start of the year. Compared to other players, Netflix's subscriber count and profitability stand out. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. ""Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field,"" Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Other analysts have piled onto that thinking, declaring the infamous streaming wars officially over. ""Netflix won the streaming wars,"" MoffettNathanson, one of the leading equity research firms for the tech and media sector, said in a note penned by analyst Robert Fishman last week. ""The media space right now is defined by a dichotomy in which Netflix stands as a lone exception."" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Geetha Ranganathan agreed, recently telling Yahoo Finance's Market Domination that the company has ""undoubtedly"" secured its No. 1 position. The ""streaming wars,"" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and, most importantly, subscribers. The goal was to attract as many users as possible. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows. At the time, Netflix (NFLX) was the ringleader. The platform secured famed producer Ryan Murphy with a high-profile $300 million contract in 2018. ""Bridgerton"" creator Shonda Rhimes also signed with the company around that time, locking in a reported $100 million deal. Others soon followed. In 2019, Warner Bros. Discovery (then known as WarnerMedia) reportedly coughed up more than $1 billion for the streaming rights to ""The Big Bang Theory."" Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA) shelled out $500 million for ""The Office"" streaming rights that same year. Even Big Tech was all in, with Apple (AAPL) sinking $6 billion into the launch of Apple TV+, which only offered nine original series at the time. But investors quickly realized that streaming is a tough business. It's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. Case in point: the profit struggles at Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount, among others. Netflix, viewed by even its competitors as ""the gold standard"" in streaming, has consistently had the upper hand due to its first-mover advantage as a pure-play streaming company. Its innovative approach to monetization, which includes controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, has also helped boost its positioning. As the market stands today, Netflix's total enterprise value is now greater than Disney, WBD, Fox, and Paramount combined. It's viewed as a growth stock on Wall Street with full-year revenue expected to climb over 15% year over year. And as the chart below shows, Netflix's estimated enterprise multiple, which is a ratio used to determine the value of a company after taking into account debt and cash levels, in addition to stock price and cash profitability, comes second only to tech giant Apple. Not too shabby for a pure-play streaming player. Fishman argued in his note that a handful of key assets will be needed for streaming players to not only catch up to Netflix but to survive the industry's massive transition. This includes a scaled streaming service (both in the US and globally), a free advertising video-on-demand (AVOD) platform, top-tier sports rights, a US broadcast network, and film and television studios. Not every company will need each one of these assets. But having any can boost a company's respective position within the industry. Take Disney (DIS), for example. The media conglomerate checks off every box except a free AVOD platform. But having a scaled streaming service in the US and abroad, like Netflix has, appears to be the formula to success — at least in the current moment. ""That really is, it seems, the end goal,"" Fishman said. ""Whether a company wants that for its own sake (all the traditional players) or to augment sales of toilet paper or cellphones [like Amazon], that is the goal."" That means joint ventures and other deals like acquisitions will be likely outcomes heading into the back half of the decade. Paramount (PARA) has already agreed to merge with Skydance Media in a deal that's set to mark an end to the Redstone family's control of the company. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Regulatory challenges could be an overhang, however. A judge temporarily blocked the launch of Venu Sports, the upcoming sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), citing antitrust concerns. The Big Tech giants would face similar dealmaking hurdles given their size, while media companies combining with each other would pose their own risk, as nearly all of the top players carry heavy debt loads. In his report, Fishman said Fox and WBD have the most complementary assets for a possible combination, especially since WBD lacks the NFL and most recently lost the NBA. The company is currently tied up in litigation after suing the NBA over the loss of those media rights. To that point, sports has emerged as the final frontier of streaming amid a dying cable TV business. But professional leagues have also been hesitant to fully abandon traditional television. That gives the upper hand to companies with a broadcast network like Fox, Comcast and Disney, in Fishman's view. ""While leagues are also increasingly comfortable partnering with streamers, as the NFL Thursday Night Football transition from Fox to Amazon showed, doing so still presents a tradeoff in viewership,"" Fishman pointed out. ""Having a broadcast network, therefore, has increasingly become a must in the eyes of top sports leagues when evaluating distribution partners."" And as new data shows, companies with exposure to both traditional television and streaming typically capture the most eyeballs. Disney's traditional broadcast and streaming properties accounted for a combined 11.3% of overall TV viewing time during the month of September, according to the latest Gauge report from Nielsen. Google's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Paramount (PARA), and Netflix rounded out the top five at 10.6%, 9.3%, 8.2%, and 7.9%, respectively. Looking ahead, ""Disney has the right asset mix to establish a true second global streaming service after Netflix,"" Fishman predicted. Disney, which is in the midst of finding its next CEO with Bob Iger's contract set to expire at the end of 2026, will report quarterly earnings on Nov. 14. But he warned the rest of traditional media companies like Comcast, Paramount, and Warner Bros. ""still need to quickly determine which path to take in order to better position themselves within the great streaming game"" — whether that means a merger, asset sale, acquisition, partnership, or something else altogether.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) reported its third quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating expectations on revenue but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. Positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher, with the chipmaker's stock up over 8% Friday. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. For the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects revenue of between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $13.6 billion. The company also said it has two new customers for its 18A processor. Revenue for the company's data center and AI business came in at $3.35 billion; analysts were looking for $3.1 billion. Intel's Client Computing segment, which deals with the sale of chips for laptops and desktops, brought in revenue of $7.3 billion, versus expectations of $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in revenue during the same quarter last year. Intel’s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, saw revenue of $4.35 billion. Wall Street was looking for $4.4 billion. The division saw revenue of $4.7 billion in Q3 2023. Intel is dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash. Intel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success. Intel’s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel’s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short. Intel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that’s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there’s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they fell slightly in Q3, according to Gartner. The company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel’s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years. It’s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company’s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before. Qualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance. Intel’s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company’s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.

Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driving its stock over 6% in premarket trading Friday despite issuing lower-than-expected guidance for the upcoming quarter. The e-commerce and cloud computing giant posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.43, beating the analyst consensus of $1.14 by $0.29. Revenue for the quarter came in at $158.9 billion, topping estimates of $157.25 billion and marking an 11% increase YoY. The operating income (OI) for the quarter came in at $17.4 billion, well ahead of $15 billion - $16 billion expectations. Barclays analysts said above-consensus revenue and OI ""should be a significant relief to Amazon bulls after a couple quarters of sequentially declining retail operating margin."" Amazon's cloud division, AWS, saw its sales increase 19% YoY to $27.5 billion, however, this was short of bullish expectations. The North America segment saw sales rise 9% to $95.5 billion, while International segment sales grew 12% to $35.9 billion. Moreover, the company's overall operating margin rose to 11%, its highest ever. AWS margins stood at 38%, also a new high. ""We think this print could go a long way to restoring the bull spirits around AMZN shares which have lagged mega cap peers all year,"" Barclays analysts added. Looking ahead, Amazon's fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $181.5-188.5 billion fell short of the $186.36 billion analyst consensus at the midpoint. The company expects operating income between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion for Q4. Despite the slight miss, Bernstein analysts led by Mark Shmulik said they ""remain constructive"" on AMZN's fourth-quarter topline ""as we expect AWS and Advertising to accelerate into year-end."" The company highlighted its continued investment in AI capabilities, including the expansion of its generative AI shopping assistant, Rufus, to several new countries and the launch of new AI-powered features for sellers and advertisers.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. reported strong results that showed a company humming on all cylinders, a testament to its efforts to cut and reallocate costs and put the cloud computing and e-commerce giant on sounder footing. Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. The Amazon Web Services cloud division, which suffered record low sales growth last year, continued to regain momentum during the third quarter. The online retail operation, which sputtered coming out of the pandemic, grew unit sales by double digits. So did revenue at Amazon’s fast-growing advertising business. Total third-quarter revenue increased 11% to $158.9 billion, the company said Thursday in a statement, exceeding estimates. Operating profit was $17.4 billion, demolishing the average estimate of $14.7 billion. “Amazon beat expectations in Q3 on the strength of the three pillars of its business: e-commerce, advertising and cloud services,” said Sky Canaves, an analyst at Emarketer. Amazon shares rose 7.3% to $200, the most since February, as the markets opened in New York on Friday. The stock had increased 23% this year through Thursday’s close. The results show the fruits of Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy’s years-long push to cut costs and streamline Amazon’s logistics operation. That has given him room to spend heavily on the new data centers required for the boom in demand for artificial intelligence services. Speaking to analysts on a conference call after the results, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Amazon expects to devote a whopping $75 billion to capital expenditures in 2024, the majority of which will go toward technology infrastructure. Jassy said he expected the company to spend even more next year. The CEO called generative AI “a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity. And I think our customers, the business, and our shareholders will feel good about this long term — that we’re aggressively pursuing it.” Cloud unit revenue jumped 19% to $27.5 billion in the third quarter, in line with estimates. Operating income generated by the unit was $10.4 billion, exceeding analysts’ average projection of $9.12 billion. “People tend to get a little uptight when Amazon talks about ramped up spending, but they’ve got such a great track record of spending large sums of money and getting really good returns on that,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co. Amazon’s key cloud rivals, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., diverged sharply when they reported earnings earlier this week. Google posted quarterly cloud sales that grew more than analysts had projected, rising to $11.4 billion, a 35% increase from the year-earlier period. Microsoft, meanwhile, forecast slower quarterly cloud revenue growth, reflecting the company’s struggle to bring data centers online fast enough to keep up with demand for AI services. Amazon reported revenue from the online store unit increased 7% to $61.4 billion in the period ended Sept. 30, while sales at the fast-growing advertising unit rose 19% from a year earlier to $14.3 billion. Total operating expenses rose 7.2% to $141.5 billion — marking the seventh consecutive quarter that Amazon’s revenue increased at a higher rate than costs. The company’s workforce rose 3% to more than 1.55 million full- and part-time employees. The Seattle-based company also projected strong growth in the quarter ending in December. Operating income will be about $18 billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $17.5 billion. Fourth-quarter sales will be as much as $188.5 billion. Analysts, on average, projected $186.4 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. --With assistance from Spencer Soper. (Updates with shares.

Here's what investors need to know today.
  U.S. stock futures are rising Friday after a slew of disappointing tech earnings sent markets lower in the prior session. After falling by 2.8% yesterday, Nasdaq futures are up by 0.5%, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are edging higher after falling by 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively. The improvement comes despite a disappointing earnings report from Apple (AAPL), whose shares are moving lower in premarket trading. Investors today will not only be watching the monthly jobs report, but also oil prices, which are rising by 2% after reports that Iran is preparing to strike back at Israel.
  Market watchers will be focused on today's U.S. jobs report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, which is expected to show that employers added fewer jobs in October due to disruptions like hurricanes Helene and Milton and the Boeing strike. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires forecast that employers will have added 110,000 jobs in October, a sharp slowdown from 254,000 in September, while the unemployment rate is expected to remain at 4.1%. While the report is the last voters will see before Election Day, it could also help influence the Federal Reserve as it is set to consider again lowering interest rates at its meeting next week.
  Shares of Amazon (AMZN) are 7% higher in premarket trading after the online retailer beat earnings expectations on growth in its cloud and advertising business. The company reported net sales of $158.9 billion, up 11% from the year-ago period and above the $157.3 billion estimate from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share (EPS) of $1.43 grew more than 50% to beat estimates. The tech giant also reported a 19% revenue jump for both its advertising unit and cloud computing division Amazon Web Services.
  Troubled chipmaker Intel (INTC) stock is surging about 6% in premarket trading after the company reported better-than-expected revenue growth. While Intel’s third-quarter revenue fell 6% year-over-year to $13.3 billion, it was above the $13.03 billion consensus estimate, helped by growth in its data center and artificial intelligence (AI) segment. While the company posted a wider-than-expected loss of $16.6 billion thanks to billions of dollars in restructuring and impairment charges, its fourth-quarter revenue forecast came in slightly above estimates.
  After workers rejected the previous offer, Boeing (BA) and its machinists union have reached a tentative contract agreement that could potentially end the strike that began on Sept. 13. Union members next Monday will vote on the new deal, which includes a 38% general wage increase over four years, up from 35% in the previous offer. The development comes after Boeing raised billions of dollars to stem a cash drain related to the strike, while also announcing plans to lay off about 10% of its workforce, or 17,000 workers. Shares of Boeing are up 2% in premarket trading.

  The company said Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue increased 19% in the three-month period, marking the segment's fastest growth in seven quarters. Meanwhile, online stores revenue grew 7% from a year earlier, with the tech giant saying it anticipates a strong holiday quarter amid improved shipping times and a larger range of lower-cost items.
  Prior to Thursday’s afterhours jump, Amazon shares had gained about 23% in 2024, slightly outpacing the S&P 500 index’s return over the same period. 
  Below, we analyze the technicals on Amazon’s chart and identify important post-earnings price levels worth watching.
  Since setting their record high in early July, Amazon shares have traded within a symmetric triangle, a chart pattern that indicates a consolidation in price before a potential breakout, usually in the direction of the prevailing trend.
  Indeed, the stock sits poised to stage an upside breakout following the company’s better-than-expected quarterly report.
  Let’s look at a key overhead level and several chart-based price targets on Amazon’s chart, while also pointing out an important support area during periods of profit taking.
  The first level to watch sits around $200, an area that may come into play on Friday where the shares could face overhead resistance near the stock’s all-time high (ATH) and psychological round number.
  To forecast an upside price target above the ATH, we can use a technical tool called the measuring principle. We do this by calculating the distance between the symmetrical triangle’s two trendlines near the start of the pattern and add that amount to the breakout point. In this case, we add $50 to $192, which predicts a target of $242.
  Investors can speculate a longer-term bullish price target by applying a bars pattern, a technique that uses prior trends on the chart to predict future directional moves.
  This works by taking Amazon’s trending move from October last year to April this year and overlaying the pattern from the most recent low, which forecasts a target of around $273. We selected this move as it commenced from an earnings-driven gap following the company’s equivalent quarter results last year.
  During periods of profit-taking, investors should keep an eye on the $192 region. This area could attract buying interest near the stock’s initial breakout point, which also closely aligns with two prominent peaks that formed on the chart in April and May.

Sell more toothpaste",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazons-plan-tackle-temu-shein-011716191.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Arriana McLymore and Ananya Mariam Rajesh (Reuters) -Amazon's push to offer more everyday essentials like toothpaste is hurting its average selling prices, but it is also a guard against rivals such as Temu and Shein that offer rock bottom prices on goods they ship from China. People are shopping more frequently at Amazon, adding more low-priced items with each checkout, Amazon said on Thursday, after it reported third-quarter revenue and profit that beat Wall Street expectations. The company's stock rose about 6% in premarket trading on Friday. The e-commerce giant has seen its market share erode in apparel as Shein and Temu quickly expanded in international markets with $12 dresses and $10 gadgets. But offering a variety of everyday products like dish detergent and floss is helping Amazon. ""The strength in everyday essentials revenue is a positive indicator that customers are turning to us for more of their daily needs,"" said Amazon's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky. ""We see that when customers purchase these types of items from us, they build bigger baskets, shop more frequently and spend more on Amazon."" In August, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said average selling prices were falling because customers were trading down to cheaper items and buying more essential goods, and that sales of bigger ticket items like computers and electronics were growing ""more slowly"" than in a robust economy. John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds which owns Amazon shares, said that he is expecting more pressure on Amazon's selling prices in the fourth quarter because of the company's mix of products. LOCAL WAREHOUSE STRONGHOLD To offset the impact of lower average selling prices, Amazon is relying on its deep network of local warehouses that allows it to ship quickly. It's ""pretty easy to choose to supply"" lower average selling price (ASP) merchandise, but much harder to be able to afford to supply them, Jassy said on Thursday. ""One of the reasons that we have been so maniacal about cost-to-serve over the last few years is that as we're able to take our cost-to-serve down, it just opens up the aperture for more items, particularly lower ASP items that we're able to supply in an economic way,"" he said. Shein is trying to ramp up selling everyday products too. Earlier this year, it began courting skincare and personal care brands such as Colgate-Palmolive to sell more household names on the platform. It launched a third party marketplace in 2023 to expand its product selection to include beauty and personal care products, household items and furniture. But companies such as Shein would be less successful in expanding to day-to-day products, said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson. Shein and Temu have specialized in offering dresses, accessories and gadgets ""that the consumer is less time-sensitive about,"" he said. ""They're not in the U.S., so they can't get me toothpaste quickly,"" Luria said, adding that any market for shipping essentials from China is likely to be a small one. Amazon is also facing competition from rivals at home. Walmart, the world's biggest supermarket chain, and smaller retailer Target have both slashed prices on essentials in a race to the bottom as they each try to woo inflation-wary shoppers. Walmart, scheduled to report third-quarter results on Nov. 19, is expected to post a 4% rise in revenue, according to analysts polled by LSEG, a slightly slower pace of growth than in the second quarter. Amazon on Thursday reported a 7% improvement in retail sales in the third quarter. In the second quarter, its retail sales had risen 5%. The operating margin for Amazon's international business jumped to 3.6% in the third quarter from 0.9% in the second quarter. Its North America margin ticked up to 5.9% from 5.6% in the previous quarter.

E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc.’s third-quarter earnings, reported after the market closed Thursday, beat Wall Street expectations by providing a wider variety of goods and improving its delivery model, company officials said. “Our team continues to focus on the inputs that matter most to customers: really broad selection, low prices, fast and free delivery, and a range of compelling Prime member benefits, including our recent additions of unlimited grocery delivery from Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh and local third-party grocery partners for $9.99 a month, and fuel savings of 10 cents a gallon at BP, Amoco and AMPM stations in the U.S.,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts. Seattle-based Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) posted earnings per share of $1.43 and $158.9 billion in revenue, beating analyst expectations of $1.14 earnings per share and $157.2 billion in revenue. Operating income increased 55% to $17.4 billion, while net income increased to $15.3 billion in the third quarter, compared with $9.9 billion in the same period last year.  The company’s North American sales increased 9% year over year to $95.5 billion, while its international sales increased 12% year over year to $35.8 billion. Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud unit, reported a 19% year-over-year increase to $27.5 billion in revenue. Jassy touted Amazon’s focus on its transportation and delivery network for the positive growth in the quarter. “For the second year in a row, we are on track to deliver at our fastest speeds ever for Prime members globally. We also continue to focus on lowering our cost to serve and are pursuing several initiatives that we believe will have meaningful long-term impact in this area,” Jassy said. “We continue to believe there are more gains on top of what we’ve captured thus far in outbound, regionalization and getting more items closer to end consumers. As such, we’re in the process of significantly changing the way we inbound items into our fulfillment network and subsequently spread them to regional fulfillment nodes.”  Amazon’s third-quarter online store sales increased 7% y/y to $61.4 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $59.6 billion. Third-quarter revenue from third-party sellers services, which includes commissions collected by Amazon, fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew 10% y/y to $37.8 billion. Amazon’s guidance for the fourth quarter calls for net sales between $181.5 billion and $188.5 billion. Operating income is expected to be between $16 billion and $20 billion, compared with $13.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. In the past few months, Amazon has made changes to its U.S. inbound network, including opening more than 15 inbound facilities, Jassy said. “While it’s still relatively early in this re-architecture, we’ve already improved our ability to spread inventory across our fulfillment centers by 25% year over year, allowing us to have more of the requisite items and fulfillment centers closest to the customer, so we can compile shipments and ship to customers even more quickly,” he said. Amazon aims to improve inventory placement, offer faster delivery time and cut transportation costs with the changes. The company is also planning to add more same-day delivery facilities to its network to get products to more customers. “[Same-day delivery] is one of our lowest-cost ways to deliver,” Jassy said. “Over 40 million customers this past quarter have had their orders delivered for free with same-day delivery, which increased more than 25% year over year.” Amazon is also using robotics to speed up deliveries, lower costs and improve its fulfillment network, he said.  “We recently launched our 12th-generation fulfillment center design for the first building in Shreveport, Louisiana,” Jassy said. “This is the first facility that incorporates our newest robotics inventions that simplify stowing, picking, packing and shipping processes. This new design reduces fulfillment processing time by up to 25%, increases the number of items we can offer for same-day or next-day delivery, and is expected to drive a 25% improvement in our cost to serve during peak within this next-generation facility.” AmazonQ3/24Q3/23Y/Y % ChangeRevenueOperating incomeNet incomeShipping costsAdjusted earnings per share The post Amazon reports $158B in Q3 revenue, beats Wall Street expectations appeared first on FreightWaves.

news,2024-10-31 19:06:00,Amazons $110 billion cloud business is minting profits even amid the expensive Gen AI arms racebut for how long?,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-110-billion-cloud-business-230630864.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazon’s quarterly financial results on Thursday surpassed analyst expectations, powered by strong revenue growth and record operating income in the company’s $110 billion cloud-computing business, sending its stock soaring as much as 6% in after-hours trading. For the quarter, Amazon generated $1.43 in earnings per share on $158.9 billion in overall revenue, beating average analyst estimates of $1.14 per share and $157.2 billion, respectively. But it was Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud-computing business—which has become a major growth driver, particularly in the AI era—that really stood out in the fiscal third-quarter results. AWS operating income grew 50% year over year to $10.4 billion. Meanwhile, revenue in the unit rose 19% from the same period a year earlier to $27.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations. The division’s operating profit margin was 38%, accelerating from 30% in the same period last year. The robust profits came even as Amazon, like its Big Tech peers, invests heavily in its own AI consumer products while also expanding its offerings of AI services and building blocks to corporate customers. But one unknown is how those profits will look as AWS’s multibillion-dollar generative AI business—in which sales are growing more than 100% year over year—develops into a larger piece of the overall Amazon Web Services business, as one analyst asked Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday’s earnings call. Jassy acknowledged that Amazon must invest heavily in AI infrastructure like data centers and chips before they are monetized or sold, but posited that “there are going to be very healthy margins here in the generative AI space” over time. For now, Amazon continues to ramp up capital spending overall, with a particular focus on expanding its data center network to support its more mature AWS businesses as well as gen AI. Increased automation and robotics investments in Amazon’s warehouse network are also playing a role in the bigger spending. “We really do believe that AI is going to be a big piece of what we do in the robotics network,” Jassy said of the company’s continued drive to automate work within its warehouses. Capital expenditures are expected to total $75 billion by the end of this year, company leaders said, meaning those investments will have increased 50% in the back half of the year from the roughly $30 billion spent in the first six months. Amazon will likely surpass that $75 billion total in 2025, Jassy told analysts on the call, potentially cutting into short-term profits in favor of what he called “a maybe once in a lifetime opportunity.” “The faster we grow demand, the faster we have to invest capital,” the CEO said of its gen AI businesses. AWS’s operating margin was also boosted two percentage points in the quarter by an accounting change related to how Amazon judges the useful life of its data centers. Another contributor to expanded margins in AWS was a “measured” pace in hiring. “Our office staff [count] is down slightly year over year,” an official told analysts. Revenue in Amazon’s core e-commerce business grew 8% to $61.4 billion on the back of a wider selection of lower-priced goods and the company’s fall sale event for Prime members. Jassy said the company continues to increase delivery speeds as it works through a multiyear restructuring of its North American warehouse network into eight regions. Last quarter, 40 million Prime customers received same-day orders at no extra cost, up more than 25% year over year, Jassy said.

He received his M.A. in journalism from The New School and his B.A. in history and political science from McGill University. Thos Robinson / Getty Images for The New York Times  The growth of generative artificial intelligence businesses is surprising even the tech industry’s most seasoned executives.
  Amazon’s (AMZN) AI business is growing three times as fast as its cloud business did at a comparable stage of evolution, CEO Andy Jassy said on a conference call with analysts Thursday. ""And we thought AWS grew pretty quickly,"" Jassy added, referring to the Amazon Web Services cloud-computing division he led before becoming CEO in 2021.
  Amazon on Thursday topped Wall Street’s estimates with its third-quarter earnings. Cloud revenue grew 19% to more than $27 billion. Sales at the unit have accelerated this year amid surging demand for AI. Amazon’s AI business, which Jassy said is already growing by triple-digit percentages, could grow even faster once the company has the infrastructure to support booming demand, the CEO said.
  ""Pretty much everyone today has less capacity than they have demand for,"" Jassy said.
  Jassy's comments echoed those of Microsoft executives who, on their company's earnings call Wednesday, said that AI demand ""continues to be higher than our available capacity.""
  Microsoft's challenges bringing cloud capacity online was a key factor behind the company's disappointing revenue guidance and the subsequent tech sell-off Thursday. (Amazon did not provide a comparable cloud revenue forecast for the current quarter on Thursday.)
  Jassy said that semiconductors are currently the hardware holding companies back from meeting demand. Amazon has developed its own AI chips—Trainium for training models and Inferentia for running those models—as it seeks to plug the gap between demand and supply for AI hardware.
  Trainium 2, the chip’s second iteration, ""will start to ramp up in the next few weeks,"" Jassy said. ""And we have a lot of customer interest.""

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 25.44%.

Amazon , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, posted revenues of $158.88 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.15%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $143.08 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Amazon shares have added about 26.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.9%. While Amazon has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Amazon: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Roku (ROKU) stock fell more than 17% on Thursday after the company's fourth quarter guidance disappointed, despite the media player reporting its first quarter of $1 billion in revenue. For the current quarter, the company estimated gross profit to hit $465 million, with adjusted EBITDA expected at $30 million. Both metrics fell below Wall Street expectations of $477 million in gross profit and $36.2 million in adjusted EBITDA. The company also said it will stop reporting streaming households as a key performance metric, echoing a similar move from streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), which will no longer report subscriber figures at the start of next year. Instead, Roku said it will focus on streaming hours, platform revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow beginning in the first quarter of 2025. ""Since our IPO in 2017, the streaming industry has evolved meaningfully, with Americans now spending significantly more TV time streaming than watching cable,"" Roku said in its earnings release. ""Our business has also grown and evolved, and we are now primarily focused on growing platform revenue and profitability."" Prior to Wednesday's release, shares had rallied more than 30% over the past three months on expectations of a strong ad market and upside to platform revenue growth. It's a critical shift for the company, which underwent a number of cost-cutting measures last year in an effort to bring down operating expenses and improve profits. Roku has recently committed to various monetization initiatives, which have included a deeper integration with programmatic advertising giant the Trade Desk (TTD). Roku said those efforts, along with tailwinds from political ad spend, will ""continue in Q4."" In the third quarter, Roku reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 16% year over year, with a net loss of $65 million, or $0.06 a share. That quarterly net loss was significantly narrower than the $0.33 loss Wall Street expected, as well as the prior-year period's $2.33 quarterly loss. Platform revenue, which includes ad sales, revenue from distribution deals, and the over-the-top streaming service, the Roku Channel, came in at $908 million, up 15% on the year. The boom was driven by strength in advertising sales, content distribution, and expansion into international markets. ""In Q3, the year-over-year growth of advertising activities across the Roku platform — excluding media and entertainment — outperformed both the overall ad market and the over-the-top (OTT) ad market in the US,"" Roku said, highlighting strength in political, retail, and consumer packaged goods ad verticals. The company reported 85.5 million streaming households, a sequential increase of 2 million and up 13% year over year. Streaming hours also increased 5.3 billion year over year to reach 32 billion in the quarter. Overall, the company has been facing more competition in the connected TV and streaming ads business. Amazon (AMZN) rolled out ads on its Prime Video streaming service earlier this year in the US. Wall Street has noted the massive disruption the tech giant has already caused in the space as companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) are also in the running for ad buyers. On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne reiterated his Underweight rating on shares, categorizing recent optimism as ""premature"" and rising competition ""as an under-appreciated risk.""
