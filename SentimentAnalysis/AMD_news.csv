Investors aren't impressed by the weakness in non-AI segments as well as a lower-than-expected guidance. We believe the stock is worth taking a deeper look at, especially with AI infrastructure investments continuing to dominate Big Tech spending. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), an American fabless semiconductor company, conceptualizes, develops, and sells computer processors and related technologies for diverse markets, from consumer to business. Founded in 1968 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the company gained a dominant market position due to its cutting-edge computing and graphics technologies, coupled with the transition to a fabless structural model that initiates outsourcing manufacturing to an external party such as GlobalFoundries. AMD deals in a variety of products, namely microprocessors, graphics processors, motherboard chipsets, Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), Accelerated Processing Units (APUs), and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In a recent development, AMD disclosed its “Zen 5” Ryzen processors for an Advanced AI experience. Although CPUs and GPUs are the major revenue drivers, over the years, the enterprise range has witnessed growing demand stemming from data centers and cloud computing growth. AMD reported an impressive $5.8 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2024, with a gross margin of 49%. The third quarter also beat analyst estimates, with the revenue coming in at $6.8 billion, powered by AI revenue. The primary clients of AMD include key technology companies, PC manufacturers like Dell and HP, and gaming console makers, particularly Sony (PlayStation) and Microsoft (Xbox). AMD serves a range of end markets, including personal computing, data centers, embedded systems, gaming, and robustly performing computing applications. It is the data center market that we will focus on. AMD reported a staggering 122% growth in the Data Center segment. The growth has come both from sales of EPYC CPUs and AMD Instinct GPUs. AMD is expected to continue to face inconsistent and cyclical AI spending from its primary clients. However, over a longer duration of time, this should not bother investors. Estimates put the total AI spending for the rest of the decade at over $500 billion. While AMD is no Nvidia, it is still a dominant market player and stands to benefit from this spending. For the above reason, the weakness in the gaming segment (69% YoY decline) and the Embedded segment (25% YoY decline) shouldn't worry investors. The company needs to divert its energy to the segment that is growing the fastest. AI is a fast developing technology and AMD wants to strike while the iron is hot. This might sound like a short-term focus for AMD, but controlling the market in the short term is what will put AMD at the center of other businesses's AI infrastructure. Once that happens, future revenue will eventually trickle down to the bottom line. For us, the 'poor' earnings report is a buying opportunity! AMD ranks 18th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 108 hedge fund portfolios held AMD at the end of the second quarter which was 124 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares are trading lower by 14% to $142.44 since Wednesday’s open after the company reported third-quarter results. The company posted revenue of $6.8 billion, which exceeded analyst expectations of $6.71 billion. Earnings per share aligned with projections at 92 cents. What To Know: AMD’s data center segment was the driving force behind the company’s growth, achieving a 122% increase to $3.5 billion. The company also saw a 29% rise in client segment revenue, totaling $1.9 billion. However, gaming revenue experienced a steep decline of 69% to $462 million, and embedded revenue fell 25% to $927 million, though embedded revenue saw an 8% sequential quarterly increase.

Each advisor has been vetted by SmartAsset and is held to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests. CEO Lisa Su attributed AMD's results to high demand for the company's EPYC and Instinct data center products, as well as Ryzen processors in the PC segment. She also projected further growth opportunities across data center, client and embedded business sectors, driven by escalating demand for computing power. Looking ahead, AMD forecasts fourth-quarter revenue of $7.5 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Adjusted gross margins for the fourth-quarter are expected to remain consistent at 54%.

Analyst Reactions: The company's expansion in artificial intelligence (AI) and data center solutions has drawn positive reactions from analysts, who suggest AMD could increasingly challenge its main competitor, NVIDIA, in the AI domain. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh noted the importance of AMD's MI300 chip, which is projected to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2024. Vinh believes that this chip could broaden customer adoption across cloud and AI applications, despite conservative fourth quarter guidance. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse pointed out that AMD's AI progress with the MI300 may eventually generate $12 billion in revenue, supporting potential earnings growth by 2025 or 2026, even though he anticipates a short-term trading range for AMD shares. Other analysts provided mixed assessments. Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer commended AMD's rapid establishment of a competitive AI franchise, projected to surpass $5 billion in annual revenue, though he suggested that investor expectations might be overly ambitious. Meanwhile, Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar highlighted strong GPU execution but acknowledged challenging guidance, noting that while AMD's GPU and server segments are promising, gaming and embedded segments pose risks.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) has a Gaudi problem on its hands – the chipmaker revealed that its AI accelerator won't even make $500 million in 2024, falling short of CEO Pat Gelsinger's target of $1 billion to $2 billion. What Happened: Gelsinger revealed during Intel's third-quarter earnings call that the Gaudi AI accelerator program will fall short of revenue targets due to a transition from second to third generation. ""The overall uptake of Gaudi has been slower than we anticipated as adoption rates were impacted by the product transition from Gaudi 2 to Gaudi 3 and software ease of use,"" Gelsinger said.

This comes at a critical time for Intel – the iconic chipmaker's stock is down nearly 55% in 2024 so far, which has drawn attention from rival Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), which is reportedly eyeing a takeover of Intel. While it is not clear if this will eventually materialize, it points to a weak phase that Intel is going through. Three of the biggest chip makers – Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

While Intel led in 2022, the company's data center revenue started declining in 2023, coinciding with Nvidia's rise. On the other hand, 2022 and 2023 were both lukewarm for AMD, but it started gathering pace in the fourth quarter of 2023. Here's how Nvidia, Intel, and AMD's data center business has performed since 2022.  Period Nvidia Intel AMD Q1 2022 $3.8B $6.1B $1.3B Q2 2022 $3.8B $4.7B $1.5B Q3 2022 $3.8B $4.4B $1.6B Q4 2022 $3.6B $4.6B $1.7B Q1 2023 $4.3B $3.7B $1.3B Q2 2023 $10.3B $4.0B $1.3B Q3 2023 $14.5B $3.8B $1.6B Q4 2023 $18.4B $4B $2.3B Q1 2024 $22.6B $3B $2.3B Q2 2024 $26.3B $3B $2.8B Q3 2024 TBA $3.3B $3.5B Source: Nvidia, Intel, and AMD | Nvidia's Q3 2024 results have not been announced yet.

Nvidia's current market capitalization stands at $3.256 trillion, while Intel's is $92.73 billion and AMD's is $233.8 billion. Gelsinger maintained an optimistic outlook, saying ""We remain encouraged by the market available to us. There is a clear need for solutions with superior [total cost of ownership] based on open standards, and we are continuing to enhance the Gaudi value proposition.""

news,2024-11-01 14:09:00,"Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Stock Got Slammed In The After-hours Trading",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-advanced-micro-devices-180914615.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, expressed concerns about the impact of rising bond yields on the stock market, suggesting that this trend could restrict the recent tech rally and limit broader sector gains. On Tuesday, he remarked that the bond market is creating significant disruptions, stating: “Bonds are wrecking the narrative, driving the people outta everything that works when the Fed cuts rates and they're going right back into tech. That's the opposite of what, if you're a true bull, you want to see.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 20 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch Despite the Dow experiencing a modest decline of 155 points, the S&P 500 managed a slight increase of 0.16%, while the NASDAQ achieved a record close with a 0.78% rise on Tuesday. Cramer pointed out that the market is becoming increasingly narrow and exclusive, primarily benefiting tech stocks at the expense of broader participation, which he considers unhealthy. Cramer explained that this trend was somewhat anticipated. He recounted how, when news broke about the Fed potentially implementing a 50 basis point rate cut, there was a surge of enthusiasm among investors who began buying bonds. They were betting on a series of rapid rate cuts, leading to expectations that bond yields would fall. Cramer noted, “It seemed a total legit thing, right? I mean the economy was slowing, that's been the pattern historically.” He added that as inflation began to ease, it appeared that history was repeating itself. However, following the significant rate cut on September 18th, something unusual occurred: long-term rates rose for the first time since 1995. This shift, which he described as a “total buzzkill,” is beginning to manifest in corporate earnings reports. He went on to say: “If the bond market doesn’t start behaving, or at least calming down, if longer-term interest rates don’t stop going up, we’re going to start losing the groups that have led us higher for months now.” In conclusion, Cramer warned: “If it [the bond market] doesn't stop its retreat, then we're gonna start questioning the idea that the Fed will keep cutting rates, ushering in a fabulous economy for 2025, which is what I was looking for.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on October 29. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.

A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Talking about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Cramer said: “AMD reported a strong set of results this evening, partially fueled by demand for their AI chips, the only ones that come close to Nvidia’s. However, they also gave you some not-so-hot guidance for the current quarter because they're worried about supply constraints. The demand for these chips is off the charts, but they may not be able to make enough of them because there's only so much high-end semiconductor capacity worldwide. Now to me, silly little me, that seemed like a high-quality problem. But it's a problem nonetheless, which is why the stock got slammed in the after-hours trading.” Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a prominent company within the semiconductor sector, particularly gaining favor among personal computer manufacturers. On October 29, the company released its third-quarter financial results, which met market expectations for earnings while exceeding sales projections. In this quarter, it reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.92, accompanied by revenues of $6.82 billion. This revenue surpassed Wall Street's average forecast of $6.71 billion, indicating a stronger-than-anticipated sales performance during this period. However, despite these positive figures, management's forward guidance raised concerns among investors, reflecting a cautious outlook. During Advanced Micro Devices’ (NASDAQ:AMD) earnings call, CEO Lisa Su addressed the current supply chain situation, stating that while the environment remains challenging, the company has effectively managed its capacity throughout the supply chain. Su emphasized that while the company expects continued tightness in supply in the coming quarters, there are plans for significant growth leading into 2025.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. On October 31, CNBC’s Steve Kovach joined ‘Money Movers’ to discuss big tech’s AI spending. Kovach observes that, apart from ChatGPT, no other AI product has achieved a breakthrough, despite ongoing efforts from many companies. Currently, most of the money is going to chip makers and cloud businesses, and there is no evidence of meaningful sales or engagement around AI products that people may want to use every day. Kovach's observation implies that tech giants continue to invest heavily in foundational AI advancements and that high-engagement consumer products may still have time to launch. Additionally, many of these big tech companies have reported that they will continue to step up their already high spending on AI infrastructure.

The company claims that Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 375 processor achieves up to 27% faster performance than its competition when looking at tokens per second, which is a key metric for LLM performance. Another benchmark proving AMD’s processor superiority is its “time to first token”. The time to first token measures the latency between the moment you submit a prompt and the time it takes for the model to start generating tokens. As per the company, the AMD Ryzen™ AI HX 375 processor is up to 3.5x faster than a comparable competitor in larger language models.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) reported its third quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating expectations on revenue but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. Positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher, with the chipmaker's stock up over 8% Friday. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. For the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects revenue of between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $13.6 billion. The company also said it has two new customers for its 18A processor. Revenue for the company's data center and AI business came in at $3.35 billion; analysts were looking for $3.1 billion. Intel's Client Computing segment, which deals with the sale of chips for laptops and desktops, brought in revenue of $7.3 billion, versus expectations of $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in revenue during the same quarter last year. Intel’s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, saw revenue of $4.35 billion. Wall Street was looking for $4.4 billion. The division saw revenue of $4.7 billion in Q3 2023. Intel is dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash. Intel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success. Intel’s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel’s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short. Intel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that’s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there’s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they fell slightly in Q3, according to Gartner. The company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel’s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years. It’s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company’s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before. Qualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance. Intel’s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company’s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.

news,2024-10-31 20:15:00,"Intel CEO calls TSMC an 'awesome' company, says the company is still waiting for CHIPS Act money",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-ceo-calls-tsmc-an-awesome-company-says-the-company-is-still-waiting-for-chips-act-money-001504215.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Another kitchen sink type of earnings day from chip giant Intel (INTC). Intel stock (INTC) rose slightly in premarket trading on Friday as the struggling US icon managed to serve up better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Shares had been up about 8% late Thursday, but a cautious earnings call subdued sentiment. ""This was a critical quarter for us, and I think [it] gives optimism for what is to come,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance moments after the company's earnings call ended (video above). The somewhat positive market reaction may be a tad overdone when digging into the quarterly results. Intel revealed $15.9 billion in total non-cash charges related to inventory write-downs and lower performance expectations for certain businesses, such as autonomous driving firm Mobileye (MBLY), where it owns a majority stake. The company reported a $5.8 billion operating loss at Intel Foundry — Intel's upstart chipmaking business — on $4.4 billion in sales. Intel took a cautious stance on the health of the foundry business and its artificial intelligence product roadmap in 2025. ""The bad news, in our view, is that Intel's AI strategy appears to have changed again, now with what seems to be a longer-term approach that centers on the traditional CPU+co-processor/accelerator approach to Enterprise class AI workloads,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note on Friday. On the earnings call, management promised to continue executing a $10 billion cost-cutting plan and exploring alternative sources of funding to support chipmaking ambitions. Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance that no deal is imminent in terms of external funding. He reiterated that Intel will push forward with opening chipmaking plants in states like Ohio and Arizona despite not receiving billions of dollars in funding yet from the CHIPS Act. The Biden administration has earmarked $8.5 billion in direct funding to Intel for its projects, but the company is still awaiting the cash as government officials iron out milestones that it must hit. ""Overall, we are seeing the CHIPS Act as a critical thing that we've invested a lot of time and energy into, and as we said on our earnings call, we're disappointed by the time that it's taken to get done,"" Gelsinger said. ""It's well over two years since the CHIPS Act passed. And over that period, I've invested $30 billion in US manufacturing and we've seen $0 from the CHIPS Act. This has taken too long. We need to get it finished."" To be sure, Wall Street still sees a bumpy road ahead for Intel. Intel faces an ""uphill battle"" to turn itself around and compete with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan's TSMC (TSM), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently told Yahoo Finance. He added the company will need some time to get its technology — notably AI chips — on par with its rivals, if they can do it at all. And BofA analyst Vivek Arya struck a cautious tone on Intel in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast (listen here). Gelsinger also clarified the company's relationship with TSMC to Yahoo Finance. Reuters reported that Gelsinger made comments early on in his Intel tenure that strained the relationship with the semiconductor manufacturing giant. In turn, TSMC pulled a discount it was giving Intel on 3-nanometer wafers. ""They are an awesome company. They have just created the foundry model. They service customers extremely well, and they service us well. And, Lunar Lake, the AI PC that we spoke about, we couldn't do it without TSMC — they've been critical to that project's success,"" Gelsinger said. ""That said, we want to be a Western foundry at scale, and we think that's seminally important for the Western world. ... And finally, I supply them with some of our advanced equipment as well. So it's a complex relationship but critically important for Intel, for TSMC, for the industry,"" added Gelsinger, who called TSMC a customer and a competitor that they have a great partnership with.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell nearly 5% Thursday on investor fears of a slowdown in artificial intelligence spending and potential delivery delays of its AI chips. Semiconductor stocks suffered across the board. The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%. Microsoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from “third parties” weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software. “Microsoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can’t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,” wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Persistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen. “As long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow … the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,” she said. “The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.” Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. “As we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,” said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company’s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be “likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.” Advanced Micro Devices’ quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company’s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday. To be sure, Big Tech companies’ AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google’s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday. Meta said it expects ""significant capital expenditure growth in 2025."" Nvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

news,2024-10-31 11:51:00,Intel to report Q3 earnings as Wall Street looks for signs of improvements at chipmaker,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-to-report-q3-earnings-as-wall-street-looks-for-signs-of-improvements-at-chipmaker-155136248.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) is set to report its Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday as the chip giant continues to contend with a troubled turnaround that’s sent its stock plummeting 52% year to date at a time when shares of rival Nvidia are soaring 154%. Intel is also dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash. For the quarter, Intel is expected to report a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the company’s Client Computing segment, which deals with sales of chips for laptops and desktops, is expected to decline 5% to $7.4 billion versus $7.8 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenue for Intel’s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, is also expected to drop some 6% to $4.4 billion versus $4.7 billion in Q3 2023. The company is, however, expected to report growth in its data center and AI segment, with revenue set to climb to $3.1 billion from $3 billion last year. It’s not exactly an earth-shattering improvement, but it’s something. Intel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success. Intel’s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel’s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short. Intel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that’s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there’s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they dipped slightly in Q3, according to Gartner. The company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel’s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years. It’s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company’s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before. Qualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance. Intel’s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company’s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.

news,2024-10-30 20:35:00,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Institutional Investors Are Shorting This Semiconductor Stock Now",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-003557055.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jefferies' Top Crowded Semiconductor Short Positions: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other semiconductor stocks. With the third quarter earnings season with us, the semiconductor industry continues to be filled with surprises. 2023 and the better part of 2024 have seen investors remain bullish about chips due to the increased market size resulting from artificial intelligence. Yet--at the same time--the pipers of Wall Street have also been wary of over-investing in artificial intelligence and the state of the broader chip manufacturing industry apart from the fortunes of the AI industry. For the latter front, October has been quite eventful. It once again reminded us that even the firms closest to a monopoly these days aren't immune from either macroeconomic headwinds or from worried investors. It saw the shares of the most important company in the semiconductor industry tank by a stunning 21.64% in just two days after a rather interesting set of events. This stock ranked 8th on our recent list of AI stocks that were trending in the news and this was unsurprising. It was due to report its earnings on October 16th, but the report ended up leaking a day earlier. Earnings leaks are a serious matter, and even more so for this firm since its business provides investors with early insight into the affairs of the semiconductor industry ahead of an earnings cycle for other firms. The leaked earnings saw the firm guide its 2025 net sales at a midpoint of €32.5 billion as it warned that the weakness in the semiconductor industry ""is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness."" Since its machines are booked months in advance, the firm has a greater insight into its future cash flows than others, and investors were further spooked by its bookings. The bookings sat at €2.6 billion as of the third quarter, for a wide miss over midpoint analyst estimates of €5 billion. Consequently, investors weren't impressed. The day that the earnings report leaked, the shares dropped by 16% for their biggest one-day drop in more than two decades. They continued their downward spiral the following day to close 6.42% lower and extend the two-day cumulative drop to 21.64%. While these drops might seem to be a bit too much since after all, you don't see multi-decade records get broken every day, they stem from the uncertainty that investors have to contend with when analyzing complex industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry is divided into three tiers. Starting from the top, firms like GPU and CPU designers are responsible for selling products to consumers and businesses. The second tier is made of manufacturers which produce the chips and the third is made of firms that provide the manufacturing equipment. Consequently, the fact that the chip manufacturing equipment provider's downbeat revenue guidance wiped off billions of dollars of capital from the semiconductor industry was unsurprising. As per Bloomberg, following the bookings miss and lower guidance, US-listed chip stocks, and Asian stocks bled a collective $420 billion in value. Michael Roeg, an analyst at investment bank Petercam Degroof provided more color into the drop. After the release, he shared that sales trends at the world's largest contract chip manufacturer ""are a misleading indicator for the overall health of the semiconductor industry."" This is because the firm ""has been spending rather low capex numbers so far this year, and they may do so again next year because their overall (plant) utilization is not as good as their sales numbers suggest."" Utilization refers to the percentage of time that expensive chip machines are running and producing chips and fabs prefer to have high rates since it decreases the time it takes for them to recuperate their investment. Low capital expenditure affects utilization since if utilization is low then chip manufacturers do not feel the need to spend heavily for new machines. In sum, these trends mean that semiconductor spending at the bottom tier of the industry remains muted unless demand picks up and utilization grows. Shifting gears, the top tier of the industry is divided into several categories. One category includes firms like Wall Street's favorite AI stock, the GPU designer whose shares are up 198% year-to-date. Due to the market's rush into AI, while investors have been kind to this firm, they have been far more prudent for others. One such firm is responsible for manufacturing silicon carbide chips that are used for power management by electric vehicles. Since the demand for EV vehicles has slowed, leading to the shares of Elon Musk's car company losing 12.3% year to date, the shares of this firm haven't done well either. They are down 18.3% year to date, and if you're interested in knowing more about this stock, we've included it in today's list. This overall bifurcation in the semiconductor industry hasn't skipped the attention of institutional investors. According to Jefferies' October Trading Positioning Survey, the percentage of investors overweight on semiconductor stocks was 42%, a strong 18-point drop over July's figures. The funds that were underweight on these stocks grew by five points from July to sit at 16%, so let's take a look at the stocks that they have shorted. Our Methodology To make our list of Jefferies' top overcrowded semiconductor short positions, we ranked the top ten crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 108 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 2.76% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor design company. The firm designs and sells CPUs and GPUs for a variety of use cases. These include personal computers, gaming consoles, data centers, and AI use cases. This makes Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) the only firm in the world that simultaneously competes with both NVIDIA and Intel. The firm has benefited from Intel's struggles and leverages product design along with TSMC's manufacturing technologies to gain market share over the larger firm. Additionally, in a price-constrained environment, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) benefits because of its affordability, and its smaller size also easily captures market share. The firm has been making aggressive investments in AI recently through multiple acquisitions that are aimed at bolstering its position in the data center industry. However, these acquisitions come at a cost and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has been debt-stressed until very recently so future leverage might create a headwind. Baron Funds mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: ""Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high performance computing technology, software, and products including CPUs, 9 GPUs, FPGAs, 10 and others. Shares of AMD remain volatile, and after a strong run earlier in the year, the stock fell during the quarter as investors continue to wrestle with AMD’s competitive positioning in the AI compute market relative to NVIDIA, who continues to strengthen its full-system solution offerings at a rapid pace. AMD also updated its MI300 GPU chip revenue expectations for the full year to “greater than $4 billion” vs. prior $3.5 billion, which disappointed the market a bit relative to high expectations. Over the long-term, we believe AMD, with its unique chiplet-based architecture and open-source software ecosystem, will play a meaningful role in the rapidly growing AI compute market, where customers don’t want to be locked into a single vendor and AMD offers a compelling total-cost-of-ownership proposition, especially in inferencing workloads. Simultaneously, we believe AMD will continue to take share from Intel within traditional data center CPUs, which, while now a slower growth market, is likely to see a near-term refresh as data centers look for ways to improve energy efficiency and optimize existing footprints."" Overall AMD ranks 5th on Jefferies' list of the top semiconductor stocks institutional investors are shorting. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. slid 11% Wednesday after the chipmaker’s revenue outlook fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, signaling that its artificial intelligence sales are growing slower than some had anticipated. Most Read from Bloomberg Is Denver’s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off? NY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow There Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC’s Historic Meatpacking District A South Korean City Plays Matchmaker to Tackle a Fertility Crisis Revenue will be roughly $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the company said Tuesday. Analysts estimated $7.55 billion on average. Though the company now expects to get more than $5 billion in sales from so-called AI accelerators this year — up from a previous forecast of $4.5 billion — some investors had been looking for a bigger bump. AMD is playing catch-up with Nvidia Corp. in the lucrative market for these chips, which help develop and run AI services. AMD is now generating billions of dollars from that type of product — a rapid rise from a year ago — but the level remains well short of the tens of billions of dollars that its rival is raking in. On a conference call following the results, Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su pushed back on concerns that AMD isn’t delivering enough growth. The company is ramping up production and earning the trust of the large data center companies that rely on AI accelerators, she said. “What I will say is customers are very, very open to AMD,” Su said. “And we see that everywhere we go. Everyone is giving us a very fair shot at earning their business, and that’s what we intend to do.” AMD shares fell to $148.60 in New York on Wednesday, the worst single-day decline since October 2022. They had been up 13% this year before the rout. AMD’s third-quarter revenue rose 18% to $6.82 billion, beating an average estimate of $6.71 billion. Profit, minus certain items, increased to 92 cents a share, in line with projections. AMD’s new MI300 accelerator products, which compete with Nvidia chips, have emerged as one of its biggest sales engines. But the growth has been hampered by the availability of supply. Like most companies in the industry, AMD no longer owns its own plants, opting instead to outsource production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company has made progress in getting more supply from its vendors, but still expects to have little latitude in terms of meeting demand if it’s above current projections, Su said on the call. “I think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we’ve also planned for significant growth going into 2025,” Su said. “We feel good about our overall supply-chain capability.” Investors track AMD’s performance as an indicator of overall demand for AI-related hardware. Massive spending by companies such as Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Microsoft Corp. on this still-new type of computing infrastructure has upended the industry. The concern among investors is that AI services aren’t yet big moneymakers, which may make it harder for companies to continue justifying the expense of buying the chips. In addition to being Nvidia’s biggest rival in AI accelerators, AMD also competes with that company in graphics chips used by computer gamers. And it goes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in personal computer and server processors. AMD’s data-center unit had sales of $3.5 billion last quarter, more than double the total from a year earlier and slightly above estimates. PC chips brought in $1.88 billion, up 29%. AMD also supplies custom processors for Microsoft and Sony Group Corp. for their game consoles. That unit has seen weaker sales, hurt by the current generation of game machines nearing the end of their life cycles. Revenue fell 69% to $462 million, missing estimates. AMD also predicted a fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin — the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production — that was just shy of projections.

Google's parent company said it expects its capital spending to increase substantially in 2025. That's good news for chip makers. The semiconductor giant is achieving record revenue thanks to AI. China is home to US e-commerce giant Amazon.com's four biggest merchant bases, according to new research, showing the significant role that the world's second-largest economy continues to play in the global supply chain despite geopolitical tensions. Shenzhen, a technology and factory hub in China's southern Guangdong province, leads the pack with 102,588 sellers registered on Amazon, collectively generating US$35.3 billion revenue annually, according to US e-commerce service provider Smartscout Alphabet's third-quarter 2024 results benefit from strength in Search, advertising revenues and Google Cloud. Google parent Alphabet posted third-quarter earnings that topped Street expectations and showed artificial intelligence (AI) progress, with both JPMorgan and Citigroup analysts noting the tech giant's strong Google Cloud revenue. Jazz (JAZZ) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations. The chipmaker's data center revenue soared 122% year over year, driven by continued powerful demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips that compete with larger rival Nvidia's chips. Google reported a 15% jump in year-over-year revenue driven by strong results in its cloud-computing division, boosting the company’s fortunes during a costly push into artificial intelligence. Boeing’s $5 billion mandatory convertible preferred deal with a 6% dividend yield has surged about 10%. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will report third-quarter financial results tomorrow, October 31, after the closing bell. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann anticipates that the tech giant will report results that are in line with expectations as the PC market stabilizes. However, he notes that this will be tempered by challenging trends in the data center sector, mainly due to market share losses to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).

They are down 18.3% year to date, and if you’re interested in knowing more about this stock, we’ve included it in today’s list. This overall bifurcation in the semiconductor industry hasn’t skipped the attention of institutional investors. According to Jefferies’ October Trading Positioning Survey, the percentage of investors overweight on semiconductor stocks was 42%, a strong 18-point drop over July’s figures. The funds that were underweight on these stocks grew by five points from July to sit at 16%, so let’s take a look at the stocks that they have shorted. Our Methodology To make our list of Jefferies’ top overcrowded semiconductor short positions, we ranked the top ten crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 108 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 2.76% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor design company. The firm designs and sells CPUs and GPUs for a variety of use cases. These include personal computers, gaming consoles, data centers, and AI use cases. This makes Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) the only firm in the world that simultaneously competes with both NVIDIA and Intel. The firm has benefited from Intel’s struggles and leverages product design along with TSMC’s manufacturing technologies to gain market share over the larger firm. Additionally, in a price-constrained environment, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) benefits because of its affordability, and its smaller size also easily captures market share. The firm has been making aggressive investments in AI recently through multiple acquisitions that are aimed at bolstering its position in the data center industry. However, these acquisitions come at a cost and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has been debt-stressed until very recently so future leverage might create a headwind. Baron Funds mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high performance computing technology, software, and products including CPUs, 9 GPUs, FPGAs, 10 and others. Shares of AMD remain volatile, and after a strong run earlier in the year, the stock fell during the quarter as investors continue to wrestle with AMD’s competitive positioning in the AI compute market relative to NVIDIA, who continues to strengthen its full-system solution offerings at a rapid pace. AMD also updated its MI300 GPU chip revenue expectations for the full year to “greater than $4 billion” vs. prior $3.5 billion, which disappointed the market a bit relative to high expectations. Over the long-term, we believe AMD, with its unique chiplet-based architecture and open-source software ecosystem, will play a meaningful role in the rapidly growing AI compute market, where customers don’t want to be locked into a single vendor and AMD offers a compelling total-cost-of-ownership proposition, especially in inferencing workloads. Simultaneously, we believe AMD will continue to take share from Intel within traditional data center CPUs, which, while now a slower growth market, is likely to see a near-term refresh as data centers look for ways to improve energy efficiency and optimize existing footprints.” Overall, AMD ranks 5th on our list of Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 9.6% in the morning session after the company reported weak third-quarter earnings results. Its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations. Revenue beat analysts' expectations by a narrow margin during the quarter, while EBITDA beat more convincingly. The outlook is weighing on shares as expectations were likely high heading into the announcement amid the ongoing AI rave. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. AMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago when the stock dropped 5.1% on the news that the company announced new data center AI chips (AMD Instinct MI325X Accelerators), barely a day after executives of rival Nvidia announced to Wall Street analysts that the Blackwell GPU (designed for AI workloads) products are ""booked out 12 months."" Also, AMD's new AI chip won't begin shipping until the first quarter of 2025. AMD's CEO Lisa Su touts her company’s new platform as superior to Nvidia's Blackwell when specific inference benchmarks are used. AMD is up 7.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $149.47 per share, it is still trading 29.3% below its 52-week high of $211.38 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,512. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will report third-quarter financial results tomorrow, October 31, after the closing bell. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann anticipates that the tech giant will report results that are in line with expectations as the PC market stabilizes. However, he notes that this will be tempered by challenging trends in the data center sector, mainly due to market share losses to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Related Read: AMD Q3 Earnings: Revenue Beat, EPS In Line, Data Center Up 122%, ‘Significant’ Growth Opportunities Ahead Driven By ‘Insatiable’ Demand According to the analyst, Intel is moving towards a more agile structure following a 15% reduction in its workforce and a suspension of its dividend, aiming to prepare for a projected slowdown in 2025. Consequently, the analyst lacks confidence in the out quarter estimates, as Intel struggles to catch up with the current AI cycle while working to improve its CPU roadmap and the Intel Foundry business, among other challenges. The analyst indicated that for the September quarter, revenue is estimated at $13 billion, aligning with the consensus, which reflects an 8% year-over-year decline and a 1% quarter-over-quarter increase. Management’s guidance for the quarter ranges from $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, Mosesmann noted. The analyst projects December quarter revenue will be $14 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $13.7 billion. This estimate represents a 9.1% year-over-year decline and a 7.7% quarter-over-quarter increase. Also Read: What’s Going On With Polestar Automotive Stock Today? The analyst forecasts FY24 revenue at $53 billion, slightly exceeding the consensus of $52 billion, with Non-GAAP EPS projected at $0.28, in line with consensus. For FY25, estimated revenue is $55 billion and Non-GAAP EPS is $0.85, which fall short of the consensus expectations of $56.4 billion and $1.10, respectively.

news,2024-10-30 13:16:00,Yahoo Finance Week in Tech: Its all about earnings and Apple,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-finance-week-in-tech-its-all-about-earnings-and-apple-171624349.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s Wednesday, and that means it’s time for Yahoo Finance’s Week in Tech. I’m Dan Howley, and this week is all about earnings. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) are each updating investors on their financial performance over the past few months, and AI is top of mind across the board. Alphabet and AMD reported their results Tuesday, and while both performed well — Alphabet beat Wall Street’s expectations on the top and bottom lines, and AMD met expectations on revenue and beat on earnings per share — shares of the companies are heading in opposite directions, with Alphabet shares headed higher and AMD shares sliding. Beyond the earnings rush, there was one other big story this week: Apple’s cavalcade of product announcements. The company not only released its initial batch of Apple Intelligence features through software updates for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, it also unveiled a line of new Mac laptops and desktops, as well as two new high-powered chips. It’s been a heck of a week so far, and we’ve still got two days to go. Big Tech’s earnings season feels like it’s been compressed into a single week, which is both a blessing and a curse for yours truly. Sure, it gets all of the work out of the way in one shot, but it also means my keyboard is getting a heck of a workout. Google parent Alphabet and AMD both provided solid results on Tuesday, but investors weren’t happy with AMD’s guidance for the current quarter, sending shares sliding more than 9% in early trading Wednesday. Alphabet shares, meanwhile, climbed more than 6% on the strength of its AI and cloud business growth. AMD said that it expects to see Q4 revenue of between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, which was just shy of expectations of $7.55 billion. That’s not exactly the kind of beat and raise Wall Street has come to expect from AI chip names. Still, even at the low end of guidance, AMD’s Q4 revenue would jump $1 billion versus the $6.2 billion it brought in during the same period last year. Despite disappointment among traders, CEO Lisa Su said there’s an “insatiable demand for more computers” among customers. Alphabet, on the other hand, is on a roll, thanks to growth in its advertising and cloud services revenue. Ad sales beat expectations, jumping from $59.6 billion a year ago to $65.8 billion in its most recent quarter, while cloud revenue increased a whopping 35%. Both businesses benefit from Google’s AI investments, with AI for Alphabet’s cloud platform helping to draw enterprise customers and improving advertising services. But Alphabet has plenty of competition, including Microsoft, which reports after the bell on Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. There’s still plenty of earnings news ahead, so stay tuned. Apple is also having a heck of a week, with updates to its iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro lines of desktops and laptops; the debut of two new chips (the M4 Pro and M4 Max); and the rollout of its Apple Intelligence platform. The new iMac gets upgraded performance via the company’s M4 chip, which first debuted alongside the new iPad Pro back in May. Apple also outfitted the iMac with a new nanotexture display coating to reduce glare and the company’s Center Stage camera that keeps subjects in frame during video calls. The Mac mini, meanwhile, gets a full redesign that shrinks its footprint to 5 inches by 5 inches. Despite its smaller size, the pint-sized mini is also more powerful than its predecessor, thanks to the inclusion of Apple’s M4 chip, as well as the option to upgrade to the new M4 Pro for even greater performance gains. Then there’s the MacBook Pro, which is available with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. Apple says the Pro can also be equipped with a nanotexture display like the iMac and that it now gets up to 24 hours of battery life. All of the systems are also built with Apple Intelligence in mind. Available via iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1, Apple Intelligence is the company’s first major step into the generative AI space. But the company is releasing the software in stages throughout the end of this year and across 2025. The first set of capabilities won’t exactly blow consumers’ minds, either. The platform’s flashiest feature is its notification summaries for texts, news updates, and other messages. But Apple plans to add ChatGPT integration to Siri and release its Apple Intelligence update in the coming months, which should prove far more exciting.

(AMD)?",Insider Monkey,https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/do-fund-managers-love-or-hate-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-1382242/,"Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive investment research and ad free browsing! Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive research! We recently compiled a list of the BofA’s List Of AI & Semiconductor Stocks That Fund Managers Love & Hate: 16 Stocks On The Manager Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA’s list that fund managers love and hate. The initial wave of artificial intelligence investing has shaken up the stock market. Suddenly, technology stocks are divided between those that have exposure to AI and those that don’t. The former category has soared to set records while the latter has been lackluster because of the state of sluggishness in the non-AI business world. Within AI stocks that have outdone themselves, semiconductor stocks are a standout. Additionally, just as is the case with broader technology stocks, semiconductor stocks are also divided between those with AI and non-AI exposure. The best example of the former category is Wall Street’s top AI stock pick. This stock is of a firm that designs and sells GPUs used to process AI workloads. Its shares are up 845% since the 2023 start and have set multiple records since OpenAI’s Chat GPT became publicly available. On the flip side, another semiconductor stock has floundered during the same period even though it’s one of the oldest and largest semiconductor companies in the world. This stock belongs to a firm that is also one of the only three companies in the world that can manufacture high-end semiconductors and it is the only one which is headquartered in the US. While the GPU designer’s shares have gained 845%, over the same time, this semiconductor stock is down 13.9%, and year to date the shares have bled an unbelievable 53.14%. Therein lies the bifurcation between semiconductor stocks that is fueled by the artificial intelligence wave. However, these returns might belong to the first stage of AI stocks only, implying that other semiconductor companies could also see gains provided robust AI software demand and the ability of firms to monetize their products.  We covered a lot of such potential stocks as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this list, there were five semiconductor stocks. Four of these are semiconductor manufacturers while the remaining stock is the firm whose designs are the backbone of the modern-day smartphone industry. The stocks are ranked 19th, 16th, 14th, 8th, and 6th. Looking at their year-to-date performance, these stocks are up roughly 45%, 51.7%, 65.7%, 97.8%, and 122% year-to-date, respectively. Safe to say, the AI wave has been kind to these stocks. The next step in our brief analysis is to see what analysts believe the future holds for these firms. To do this, one particularly useful ratio is the forward price to earnings since it gauges the current price to analyst estimates of future earnings. For these five phase two AI semiconductor stocks, the forward P/E ratios in respective orders are roughly 31.25, 50.51, 29.41, 25.19, and 99 times. The forward P/E ratio for global and US semiconductor stocks is 45.77 so most of these stocks are fairly valued. Consequently, this implies that in case of an AI correction that sees investor sentiment evaporate for any reason, these stocks might not be hit as hard as those speculating about an ‘AI bubble’ might worry, but if Wall Street finds more reasons to add to its AI euphoria, then their valuation might further bloom for more gains. Shifting gears, the average forward P/E ratio for the semiconductor industry also leads us to wonder which stocks are driving this average value higher. After all, the six AI chip stocks we’ve covered above include some of the biggest companies in the world. However, high P/E ratios commonly belong to smaller companies that earn small profits but have a much higher share price. Two stocks that we’ve identified that have at least 2x the average forward P/E ratio are both unprofitable right now. The one with the higher forward P/E ratio of 196.08 ranks 20th on our list of Piper Sandler’s Top Technical Stock Picks: 20 Best Stocks while the second with a beefy ratio of 133.33 ranked 32nd on this list of AI stocks that were recently trending. So, the next question to ask is, what makes these stocks so special that despite the fact that neither is currently profitable, investors have valued their shares more than 100 times over their projected earnings? Well, starting from the first stock with the higher P/E ratio, this firm is one of the few hardened integrated circuit manufacturers in the US. It makes radiation-resistant chips for the US military and its tools enable chip designs at various nodes. The second stock, which is up 49% year to date, is a specialty chip manufacturer that makes and sells silicon-based timing devices as an alternative to quartz-based products. These are used in applications such as edge computing and 5G networks – systems that are closer to end users and therefore must endure more strenuous working environments. Our Methodology  To make our list of semiconductor stocks that fund managers love and hate according to BofA, we used its recent list of semiconductor stocks that were popular or losing popularity with fund managers. The list was divided into two sections based on expansion or decline in ownership.  Stocks within each category were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024. For an interesting exercise, you can also compare these stocks with those on our lists of Goldman Sachs’ List Of Stocks That Hedge & Mutual Funds Love & Hate: 28 Stocks On The Mutual and Hedge Funds Radar. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 108 Section: Losing Popularity  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is the second biggest firm in the x86 CPU market which makes it quite important as this industry is effectively a duopoly. It competes with Intel in the CPU market and NVIDIA in the GPU market, making Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) the only firm capable of targeting both of the biggest chip companies in the industry. Additionally, acquisitions such as that of an FPGA company mean that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a rare company capable of competing at all ends of the AI ecosystem, from CPUs to GPUs, and customizable chips. However, it is a distant second to NVIDIA in the GPU market and also depends on non-AI enterprise data center spending for a large portion of its revenue. Yet, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) could see tailwinds as AI use accelerates in the business world and firms seek low-cost accelerators amidst supply constraints for NVIDIA products. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s management commented on its data center business during the Q2 2024 earnings call. Here is what they shared: “Turning to the segments, data center segment revenue increased 115% year-over-year to a record $2.8 billion, driven by the steep ramp of Instinct MI300 GPU shipments and a strong double-digit percentage increase in EPYC CPU sales. Cloud adoption remains strong as hyperscalers deploy fourth-gen EPYC CPUs to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. We are seeing hyperscalers select EPYC processors to power a larger portion of their applications and workloads, displacing incumbent offerings across their infrastructure with AMD solutions that offer clear performance and efficiency advantages. The number of AMD-powered cloud instances available from the largest providers has increased 34% from a year ago to more than 900. We are seeing strong pull for these instances with both enterprise and cloud-first businesses. As an example, Netflix and Uber both recently selected fourth-gen EPYC Public Cloud instances as one of the key solutions to power their mission critical customer facing workloads. In the enterprise, sales were increased by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple large wins in the quarter with financial services, technology, health care, retail, manufacturing, and transportation customers, including Adobe, Boeing, Industrial Light & Magic, Optiver, and Siemens. Importantly, more than one-third of our enterprise server wins in the first half of the year were with businesses deploying EPYC in their data centers for the first time, highlighting our success attracting new customers, while also continuing to expand our footprint with existing customers.” Overall AMD ranks 11th on our list of the AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA’s list that fund managers love and hate. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investing.com -- Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) unveiled guidance for current-quarter revenue and artificial intelligence chip sales that disappointed investors, sending shares down by more than 8% in premarket US trading on Wednesday. Due to soaring AI chip demand from a host of large tech firms like software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), AMD has been struggling to provide the necessary supply of processors. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Lisa Su flagged that supplies of AI chips would be restrained heading into the upcoming year. ""[G]oing into the next few quarters going into 2025, I think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we've also planned for significant growth going into 2025,"" Su said. For the fourth quarter, AMD's revenue guidance of $7.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, was slightly under analysts' consensus forecasts of $7.55 billion at the midpoint. AMD also increased its projections for sales of its key AI chips for next year to $5 billion from its prior estimate of $4.5 billion, although investors were underwhelmed by the guidance. In a note to clients, analysts at Morgan Stanley said AMD's returns were ""essentially in line"" with consensus forecasts, adding that they were ""somewhat surprised"" by the sell-off in the stock. The chipmaker -- and rival to AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) -- posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 in the third quarter, in line with analyst projections. Group-wide revenue also rose by 22% versus the year-ago period to $6.82 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $6.71 billion. The company's data center segment was a standout performer, with revenue more than doubling to $3.5 billion, while its client business showed strong growth as well. But this strength was partly offset by sales at its gaming unit, which declined 69% to $462 million. ""[W]e still see 2024-25 as investment years for the AI opportunity, and think some revenue [and] earnings expectations are still too high,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore wrote.

Ryan / The Boston Globe via Getty Images  Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) shares are jumping in premarket trading after the tech giant beat earnings estimates on surging cloud revenues; Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are tumbling after its results missed the mark; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock is sinking after its net income and sales guidance disappointed investors; shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) are dropping after its same-store sales outlook came in below expectations; and Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) shares are rising ahead of their earnings reports after the close. Here's what investors need to know today.
  Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are up 6% in premarket trading after the tech giant reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. Alphabet's revenue climbed 15% year-over-year to $88.27 billion and net income came in at $26.3 billion, or $2.12 per share, beating consensus expectations of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Google Cloud delivered revenue of $11.4 billion, exceeding projections and representing 35% growth from the year-ago period as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) surged.
  Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) are sinking 10% in premarket trading after it reported third-quarter revenue and net income that were well short of analysts' estimates. Lilly reported a profit of $970.3 million, or $1.07 per share, well below the $1.69 billion and $1.87 per share analysts were projecting. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.18 was barely half of the expected $2.18. Weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound continue to boost Eli Lilly's sales, with its revenue of $11.44 billion coming in above last year's $9.50 billion, although below the $12.18 billion consensus.
  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares are falling 8% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported weaker-than-expected net income and guidance for the fourth quarter. While the company's third-quarter revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $6.82 billion, ahead of expectations, its net income of $771 million, or 47 cents per share, was below projections. AMD said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, with the midpoint below analysts' consensus of $7.6 billion.
  Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares are falling 6% in premarket trading after the restaurant chain reported a weaker-than-expected sales forecast. Chipotle said it expects to see 2024 same-store sales increase in the mid- to high-single-digit range, while analysts were anticipating a 7.5% growth rate, according to Visible Alpha. The chain's revenue of $2.79 billion met expectations, while its net income of $387.4 million beat estimates. 
  Shares of Magnificent Seven firms Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) are trading higher in premarket trading ahead of their scheduled earnings releases after markets close today. Microsoft stock is up by 2% ahead of its earnings report, which is expected to show the tech giant deliver a 14% jump in quarterly revenue. Facebook parent Meta, whose shares are also higher by 2%, is expected to register revenue growth of 18%. Earnings from Apple, Amazon, and Intel are scheduled for Thursday.

(Corrects paragraph 3 to say $5 billion AI chip sales target is for 2024, not 2025) (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices shares fell 8% on Wednesday after the chip company's revenue forecast failed to impress investors looking for a bigger windfall from the AI boom. AMD could lose around $20 billion in market value, based on premarket movements. The company has been one of the biggest winners of the chip demand boom sparked by the rise of generative AI, with its shares up nearly 156% since end-2022. Its soft quarterly revenue forecast and a $5 billion AI chip sales target for 2024, however, showed that demand for the processors was rising faster than their production, with CEO Lisa Su saying chip supplies will be tight going into next year. ""It is probably unpalatable for an 'AI name' to even guide inline, let alone below,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. ""At this point AI performance, while not bad in the objective sense, appears unlikely to drive upside to current expectations, and talk of 2025 'lumpiness' in the business will probably increase risk (or at least raise some eyebrows)."" Other chip firms such as Arm and Qualcomm also fell more than 2%. But AI chip leader Nvidia was down just 0.3% in a sign that investors did not expect a similar supply shortage impact on the company. Both Nvidia and AMD rely on chip-making giant TSMC to manufacture their advanced AI chips, but analysts have so far shown little concern about Nvidia's AI chip supply. ""AI still dominates this (AMD) story, and while the company did raise (sales expectations) every quarter this year, the concern from here is that AMD won’t be able to provide upside to Street estimates that are already $8 billion-$9 billion for calendar 2025,"" Jefferies analysts said. At least 10 analysts lowered their target price on the AMD stock, while 8 raised their views, moving the median to $187.50, according to LSEG data. That represents an upside of nearly 13% to the company's last closing price. AMD trades at nearly 32 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with 36 times for Nvidia.

(AMD) In Any Weakness For The Trust Because This Is A Long-term Terrific Story",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-buying-more-073626260.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 20 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's latest game plan. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently advised investors to maintain composure as major companies release their earnings this week. Additionally, he highlighted the significance of the upcoming nonfarm payroll report, set to be released on Friday, which he believes will have considerable implications for interest rates. He said that weak hiring figures could prompt the Federal Reserve to continue cutting rates. Last Friday, Cramer noted a mixed performance in the markets: the Dow dropped by 260 points, the S&P fell slightly by 0.03%, while the Nasdaq managed a gain of 0.56%. Cramer characterized the current market conditions as a preparatory phase for an eventful week ahead, urging viewers to pay close attention. READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks Cramer emphasized the importance of the employment data released on the first Friday of the month, particularly in light of the forthcoming Fed meeting. “Speaking of employment, on the first Friday of the month, we get the nonfarm payroll report. I can't stress how important this number is. We have an upcoming Fed meeting and we're now seeing [that] cyclicals really missed their numbers because of higher interest rates. A lot of them are rolling over. But if employment stays as strong as it's been, then we're going to hear that there will be no November rate cut.” Throughout his commentary, Cramer conveyed a clear message: while it may be tempting to sell, this period aligns with a cycle of Fed rate cuts, suggesting that buying could be the more prudent strategy. He reminded viewers that this week feels charged with significance, likening it to a playoff atmosphere where the stakes are exceptionally high. In his concluding remarks, Cramer said: “Bottom line, huge week, huge opportunity. Just please remember, the first move’s been the wrong move, I'd say probably maybe, almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers, listen to the conference call before you pull the trigger.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 20 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 25. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Cramer likes Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and called it a “long-term terrific story”. “Just say you like AMD as we do for the Charitable Trust. We know that AI is big big big. Big enough for more than just one chip maker. AMD won't catch NVIDIA, but it will do enough to take chunks of the business. Plus, it has tremendous PC exposure right into the teeth of a big PC refresh cycle. We're buying more AMD in any weakness for the Trust because this is a long-term terrific story.” Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has established itself as a significant player in the semiconductor industry. The company has gained substantial traction among personal computer manufacturers due to the popularity of its GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), and neural processing units (NPUs). Its Ryzen AI 300 series NPUs are set to power various computing platforms from manufacturers such as Microsoft, Asus, Lenovo, and HP. CEO Lisa Su highlighted in July that a significant increase in the adoption of Instinct MI300 GPUs contributed to this product family surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. In the second quarter, the company reported $2.8 billion in data center sales, marking an impressive 114% increase compared to the same period last year. On October 10, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) hosted an event titled “Advancing AI,” where Lisa Su revealed details about the next generation of chips. During this event, she also announced plans to introduce the MI350X GPU in the upcoming year, which is set to directly compete with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, with shipments expected to commence in the latter half of 2025. Overall AMD ranks 6th on the list of stocks featured in Jim Cramer's latest game plan. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

news,2024-10-29 22:27:00,AMD Stock Price Levels to Watch After Post-Earnings Plunge,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/amd-stock-price-levels-to-watch-after-post-earnings-plunge-8736507," Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares moved sharply lower in extended trading on Tuesday after the chipmaker reported third-quarter earnings that came in below expectations and issued a light current quarter revenue outlook, despite record data center revenue.
  During the company’s conference call, CEO Lisa Su told analysts that the chipmaker now anticipates data center revenue to exceed $5 billion in 2024, up from her July forecast of $4.5 billion, However, the stock’s afterhours decline indicates investors could have been looking for more amid insatiable artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure demand. 
  AMD shares have gained around 13% year to date as of Tuesday’s close, underperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq index’s return by about half over the same period. The stock fell 7.6% to $153.57 in after-hours trading Tuesday.
  Below, we analyze the technicals on AMD’s weekly chart and point out important post-earnings price levels that other investors may be watching.
  After an inverted hammer marked AMD’s all-time high (ATH) in early March, the stock has traded within a textbook descending channel.
  More recently, the price has rallied into the pattern’s upper trendline, though lower volumes suggest that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the company's quarterly results.
  Amid the stock’s projected post-earnings sell-off, let’s look at key support levels that may come into play and also forecast a chart-based price target to watch if the shares resume their longer-term uptrend.
  The first important support level to monitor sits around $162. Although the stock sits poised to open below this area on Wednesday, it’s worth watching if bulls make an attempt to defend a trendline linking the prominent November 2021 peak and a range of comparable trading levels within the descending channel.
  A decisive breakdown below this level could see the shares decline to the $132 area, a location where investors may look for buying opportunities around a series of prices situated near the June swing high and August swing low.
  Further selling in the stock opens the door for a fall to around $112, around 33% below Tuesday’s closing price, where the shares find a confluence of support from the 200-week moving average and a horizontal line stretching back to August 2021.
  If AMD shares resume their longer-term uptrend, we can forecast a bullish price target using a bars pattern, a technique that uses historical trends on the chart to predict future price moves.
  In this case, we take the stock’s trend higher from October 2023 to March this year and reposition it from the early August low, which projects a price target of around $275.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.8 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.

Advanced Micro shares have added about 8.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 22.1%. While Advanced Micro has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock.

  The chipmaker’s third-quarter revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $6.82 billion, ahead of the Visible Alpha analyst consensus. Net income at $771 million or 47 cents per share was up from $299 million or 18 cents per share a year earlier, but below Street estimates as costs rose.
  AMD's revenue gains came as data center sales more than doubled to a fresh high of $3.5 billion, driven by demand for the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips.
  The results come after AMD launched its next generation of AI chips at its Advancing AI event earlier this month, but did not raise its AI sales outlook or announce new customers as many investors had hoped, weighing on its stock price.
  AMD said Tuesday it expects fourth-quarter revenue to land between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, up from $6.2 billion in the prior-year quarter. The analyst consensus was at the higher end of that range at $7.6 billion, according to Visible Alpha.

AMD (AMD) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings on Tuesday, meeting expectations on the earnings per share and beating on revenue. But Wall Street wasn't too keen on the company's Q4 revenue outlook, which it said will come in between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion. Wall Street was looking for $7.55 billion. Shares of the chip maker fell more than 5% immediately following the announcement on fears of slowing AI growth for the company. Despite that, CEO Lisa Su said demand for the company's offerings is strong. ""Looking forward, we see significant growth opportunities across our data center, client and embedded businesses driven by the insatiable demand for more compute,"" she said in a statement. For the quarter, AMD saw adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.8 billion. Wall Street was anticipating adjusted EPS of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg. The company saw EPS of $0.70 per share on revenue of $5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. AMD’s data center business segment — its most important — brought in $3.5 billion versus expectations of $3.46 billion, and from $1.59 billion in Q3 2023. The company’s second-largest segment, its Client business, which involves sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, topped $1.9 billion, versus expectations of $1.71 billion and up from $1.45 billion last year. AMD’s gaming segment, however, collapsed 69% year-over-year, bringing in revenue of $462 million versus $1.5 billion in the same period last year. The gaming segment includes sales of AMD’s Radeon graphics cards for laptops and desktops and custom chips for consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Graphics cards for gaming PCs and console sales have fallen since their peak during the pandemic, which saw consumers buying up devices to help them fill their nights and days when they were stuck inside on the couches. AMD’s earnings come less than a month after the company detailed three of its upcoming chips including its 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) for servers, its Instinct MI325X AI chip, and the Ryzen AI Pro 300 for AI PCs for enterprise users. The chip company's stock price is up 65% in the last 12 months, beating out the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which is up 36%, and clobbering struggling Intel (INTC), whose stock price is down a staggering 34%. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to surge, climbing an eye-watering 246% in the last year. AMD is Nvidia’s biggest rival in the AI chip space. Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that’s not saying much. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Revenue: $6.82 billion vs analyst estimates of $6.71 billion (1.6% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.92 vs analyst expectations of $0.92 (in line) EBITDA: $1.89 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.49 billion (27% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q4 CY2024 is $7.5 billion at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $7.55 billion Gross Margin (GAAP): 50.1%, in line with the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 144, down from 166 in the previous quarter Operating Margin: 10.6%, up from 3.9% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 27.7%, up from 24.8% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 7.3%, up from 5.1% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $258.8 billion “We delivered strong third quarter financial results with record revenue led by higher sales of EPYC and Instinct data center products and robust demand for our Ryzen PC processors,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. Founded in 1969 by a group of former Fairchild semiconductor executives led by Jerry Sanders, Advanced Micro Devices or AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the leading designers of computer processors and graphics chips used in PCs and data centers. The biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles. Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, AMD’s 32.2% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. This is encouraging because it shows AMD’s offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Long-term growth is the most important, but recency is neccessary for semiconductors because of Moore's Law, which suggests the pace of technological innovation is so high that yesterday's hit new product could be obsolete today. AMD’s recent history shows its demand slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 3.2% over the last two years is well below its five-year trend. This quarter, AMD reported year-on-year revenue growth of 17.6%, and its $6.82 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.6%. Management is currently guiding for a 21.6% year-on-year increase next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 28.1% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is healthy and indicates the market thinks its newer products and services will spur faster growth. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback. Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, AMD’s DIO came in at 144, which is 34 days above its five-year average. These numbers suggest that despite the recent decrease, the company’s inventory levels are higher than what we’ve seen in the past. We were impressed by AMD’s strong improvement in inventory levels. We were also excited its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts’ expectations. The outlook is weighing on shares, and shares traded down 5.4% to $157.25 immediately following the results.

(Corrects paragraph 1 of Oct. 29 story to say $5 billion AI chip sales forecast is for 2024, not 2025) By Arsheeya Bajwa and Max A. Cherney (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday forecast fourth-quarter revenue just shy of estimates and raised its artificial intelligence chip sales forecast to $5 billion for 2024 - not enough to impress investors. AMD stock slid nearly 7% in extended trading, erasing most of the 8% gain in the last three trading days and much of the more than 10% gained this year. Demand for AI chips from big technology companies including Microsoft and Meta has been rising much faster than their supply from AMD and larger rival Nvidia, limiting the chip companies' ability to tap the order surge. AMD CEO Lisa Su said that supplies of AI chips would be tight going into next year. ""AMD's stock was priced for a beat and raise,"" Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan said. ""Clearly, AMD's (fourth-quarter) outlook was not good enough for investors."" Revenue in its data center business, which includes AI chips, surged 122% to $3.5 billion. AMD still trails front-runner Nvidia, which commands about 80% of the AI semiconductor market. Su raised the forecast for AI chips, which are included in the data center segment, by half a billion from the $4.5 billion it estimated in July. In the earnings call with analysts, Su also discussed Microsoft and Meta expanding their use of the company's AI chips. Microsoft and Oracle offer the MI300X chips for rent as part of their cloud computing service. Analysts largely believe Nvidia will maintain its majority market share for the foreseeable future, owing in part to its entire AI ecosystem that includes the CUDA software and networking equipment. Capacity for the production of AI chips will be very tight going into 2025, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer TSMC said in July, marking a significant hurdle for the supply of these advanced semiconductors. AMD's ability to sell more of its advanced AI processors is hampered by the supply constraints at TSMC, Running Point Capital chief investment officer Michael Schulman said. The company expects revenue of $7.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million for the fourth quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $7.54 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. AMD forecast an adjusted gross margin of roughly 54%, which met analyst expectations. The company reported revenue of $6.82 billion for the third quarter, compared with estimates of $6.71 billion. AMD reported adjusted earnings of 92 cents a share, in line with analyst expectations. AMD's results weighed on the chip sector in extended trading. Arm Holdings fell 1.7%, Nvidia dropped 0.3%, Intel fell 0.4%. Chip equipment maker Lam Research fell 0.8%. ""Most investors, once they digest AMD’s good results combined with their lackluster forecast, will try to extrapolate what that means for the rest of the AI-chip and semiconductor market,"" Schulman said.

(Reuters) - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. 1968 - Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore found Intel, helping reshape California's Santa Clara Valley from fruit orchards into the Silicon Valley tech hub. 1971 - Intel introduces the 4004, the world's first commercially made programmable microprocessor, with 2,300 transistors. These were among the first chips that could be programmed to perform specific functions, unlike previous processors that were hardwired only for a certain task - a turning point in the history of the semiconductor industry that laid the groundwork for the development of CPUs. 1981 - Intel's 8088 microprocessor, with 29,000 transistors, becomes the brain in the IBM Personal Computer, kicking off the era of personal computing. 1982 - Advanced Micro Devices, co-founded in 1969 by a fellow Fairchild Semiconductor alum, becomes a second producer of the Intel 8086 microprocessor. This partnership would later cause a long legal battle over AMD's rights to use Intel's x86 chip architecture, which is the basis of a majority of PC and server chips today. 1985 - Intel decides to withdraw from the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market - its initial claim to fame - as slumping demand prompts it to focus on microprocessors. 1985 - Intel begins cutting its workforce, impacted by an industry-wide downturn brought on by memory over-supply. Intel would lay off thousands of workers for the remainder of the 80's. 1987 - Andy Grove, famous for his motto, ""Only the paranoid survive"", becomes Intel's third CEO and steers the company through a massive slump in the chip market. Intel solidifies its position as a linchpin of the American semiconductor industry, while players like AMD and National Semiconductor struggle. 1991 - Intel launches its ""Intel Inside"" marketing campaign for PCs with its chips, and the television commercials become a cultural phenomenon. 1993 - Intel introduces Pentium microprocessors, boasting 3.1 million transistors and running 300 times faster than the 8088. 1999 - Intel and Windows maker Microsoft, allies referred to as Wintel, become the first two tech companies to be added to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average. 1999 - Nvidia introduces its first graphics processing units (GPU), which during the 2000s would become an important fixture in PCs and servers with the advent of gaming and multimedia applications. Intel's development strategy remained focused on CPUs, Reuters reported, eventually costing it a head start in the AI revolution of the 2020s. 2000 - Driven by the dot-com bubble, Intel's stock market value reaches a record $495 billion as it, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell benefit from an explosion of computer sales. By late 2024, Intel's value would fall below $100 billion. 2007 - Apple launches the iPhone, helping kick off a mobile phone boom that Intel mostly missed. Under CEO Paul Otellini, Intel turned down a deal to make iPhone processors because it did not stand to profit enough from the arrangement. Instead, Apple used chips based on designs from Arm Holdings, whose tech now dominates the mobile market. 2009 - Intel agrees to pay AMD $1.25 billion to settle decades worth of legal disputes, amid increased antitrust scrutiny over Intel's dominance in the chip market. 2013 - Otellini steps down as CEO amid pressure from investors. Former chief operating officer Brian Krzanich becomes CEO, with a focus on diversifying the business beyond PCs to the data center market and automotive chips through acquisitions like Altera and Mobileye. 2014-16 - Under CEO Krzanich, Intel held back on using next-generation equipment used in the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technique, crucial for next-generation chips, believing it would ""never work"" and focusing the company's engineers elsewhere. The fateful decision sets back Intel's design and manufacturing businesses for roughly five years. 2016 - Intel cuts 12,000 jobs amid one of the PC industry's worst declines in years. 2017 - Samsung overtakes the U.S. company as the world's largest chipmaker by revenue as prices soared in Samsung's stronghold of the memory market. At the same time, Intel cedes its manufacturing technology lead to Taiwan's TSMC, now the world's largest contract chip manufacturer with customers including Apple. 2018 - Krzanich steps down amid mounting manufacturing setbacks. Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan becomes interim CEO. 2018 - Intel declines an offer to invest in OpenAI; CEO Swan does not believe generative AI will reach market in near future. OpenAI by 2024 has a larger market valuation than Intel. 2020 - Intel's annual revenue peaks at $77.87 billion, bolstered by pandemic sales of PCs. Revenue then declines as Intel struggles with increased competition from AMD and Nvidia. 2020 - Nvidia's market value overtakes Intel's as Nvidia GPUs become the key chip for generative AI technology. 2021 - Pat Gelsinger becomes CEO, winning praise from investors who want a turnaround after manufacturing setbacks and deepening market share losses. Gelsinger focuses on transforming Intel into a producer of chips for other ""fabless"" firms, including his ""five nodes in four years"" plan that would cost billions and sap Intel's cash flow and margins. 2021- Intel announces plans to invest $20 billion to build two manufacturing facilities in Arizona. 2022 - Intel's market value sinks below AMD's as the smaller chipmaker eats away at Intel's share of the server CPU and PC chip market and becomes the most formidable challenger to Nvidia. 2024 - Intel unveils a plan to invest $100 billion across four U.S. states to build and expand factories, after securing federal grants and loans aimed at bolstering U.S. chip manufacturing. 2024 - Intel cuts 17,500 jobs, suspends dividend and embarks on a turnaround of its money-losing manufacturing business.

news,2024-10-29 12:15:00,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Targets AI Growth with GPU Advancements, Piper Sandler Highlights 26% Upside",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-nasdaq-161528851.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks you should not miss. Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at US Bank Asset Management Group, states that the two things to look for in the earnings season are consumer spending and companies' spending on technology, particularly artificial intelligence. Recent reports from the financial sector and retailers suggest that consumers are in good financial shape, setting the stage for a promising holiday season as well as providing a solid opportunity for growth in the fourth quarter. He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss  and Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4 Sometimes, these AI-related names are a bit overvalued and there is volatility; but the long-term thesis remains strong. In fact, these “down days” can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major “AI arms race” is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings. Just like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn’t surprised by recent market developments. It’s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is “easy to hope” that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, “reaffirms that confidence”. With that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents. “We think every company in the world, whether it’s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.” -Taylor told CNBC in an interview. In other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo’s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both. ""Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety."" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company’s Master Perfumer Advancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI’s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company: “Neither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready”. With that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Photo by Javier Esteban on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is an American multinational corporation that specializes in manufacturing semiconductor devices used in computer processing. By integrating technology across CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, it strives to create a strong ecosystem that supports the development of powerful AI applications. Even though Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has failed to make a significant dent in the AI chips market, Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar continues to view AMD as a “top large-cap pick”. On October 25, the analyst rated AMD shares as Overweight (i.e. Buy), along with a $200 price target. This indicates a potential 26% upside in the coming months. The analyst’s positivity comes from AMD's management's comments regarding the GPU outlook with the prospect of MI300 adoption setting the scene for “outperformance in the data center segment”. He expects the company to exceed the $5 billion annual revenue goal for its GPUs, driven by “implied GPU ramp”. The analyst states that there were also supply constraints at the beginning of the year, but the momentum is building again with the introduction of MI325. “All in all, AMD has taken some significant steps in software/model conversion to eliminate the gap relative to competition. We feel that with the closure of the ZT Systems deal in 1H25, AMD will close another gap to NVDA in rack level performance.”  Overall AMD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

On Tuesday at its annual Partner Summit conference in Los Angeles, Cisco unveiled a new high-density GPU server for customers who want to train large language models. It also took the wraps off ""AI PODS,"" a product designed for clients keen on inferencing, the process artificial intelligence models use to derive conclusions from new data. Cisco said both products are built to handle intensive AI workloads powered by Nvidia's (NVDA) accelerated computing. ""It's really an important event for us, and we've taken the opportunity here to start what is really a rolling thunder of announcements around AI infrastructure,"" Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins told Yahoo Finance. Robbins is aiming to keep the momentum going with Cisco's foray into AI. The company has shipped $1 billion of orders to five of the six top hyperscalers. It expects another $1 billion in its current fiscal year. ""I think 2025 is going to be the year of the enterprise application,"" Robbins added. ""I think we've seen this focus on the training models that are out there and ChatGPT and Anthropic, and you got all these models that people are using. And I think now the enterprises are really figuring out what are the use cases that we can deploy."" The AI product drop comes as Cisco's stock has begun to perk up after being largely dead money for the past year amid several challenging quarters. Shares of the networking giant are up nearly 20% in the past three months, outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 7% advance. Rival Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock is down 3% in the last months. Cisco's stock has still underperformed, gaining only 9% in the past year compared to a 40% improvement in the S&P 500. The stock's recent resurgence stems from better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings in mid-August. Cisco surprised some on the Street by delivering product order growth of 14% and sounding optimistic about the integration of its $28 billion purchase of Splunk. The Street is also growing comfortable that Cisco will have a key role in building out the world's AI infrastructure like it helped lay the structural pipes as the internet took off in the 1990s and early 2000s. Networking sales —a key driver of sentiment on Cisco's stock — rebounded in the quarter, spurring hope for further gains over the next 12 months. ""We do think there is a lot of upside potential in the current guidance, and critically, there are multiple levers for upside in FY25 across revenues and margins,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients. Daryanani says a successful integration of Splunk and ongoing improvement in networking demand is key to his Outperform rating on Cisco's stock. Daryanani added, ""Our upside scenario would require both great execution and end market recovery, but we think it is a possibility."" Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AMD (AMD) will report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, in what will serve as a temperature check on the health of the artificial intelligence market. AI continues to drive shares of tech giants ranging from AMD rival Nvidia (NVDA) to customers like Microsoft (MSFT), and investors and analysts are hoping to see their big bets pay off. AMD’s earnings come less than a month after the company detailed three of its upcoming chips including its 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) for servers, its Instinct MI325X AI chip, and the Ryzen AI Pro 300 for AI PCs for enterprise users. Shares of the chip company are up 65% in the last 12 months, beating out the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which is up 36%, and clobbering struggling Intel (INTC), whose stock price is down a staggering 34%. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to surge, climbing an eye-watering 246% in the last year. AMD is Nvidia’s biggest rival in the AI chip space. Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that’s not saying much. For the quarter, AMD is expected to bring in adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg. That’s up from $0.70 per share and $5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. AMD’s data center business segment — its most important — is set to bring in $3.46 billion, up from $1.59 billion in Q3 2023. Analysts are expecting $1.39 billion from its AI/GPU revenue alone. The company’s second-largest segment, its Client business, which involves sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, is set to bring in $1.71 billion, versus $1.45 billion last year. AMD’s gaming segment, however, is projected to drop in a big way. Analysts anticipate the business will bring in $572 million in the quarter. That’s nearly a $1 billion decline from the same period last year. The gaming segment includes sales of AMD’s Radeon graphics cards for laptops and desktops and custom chips for consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Graphics cards for gaming PCs and console sales have fallen since their peak during the pandemic, which saw consumers buying up devices to help them fill their nights and days when they were stuck inside on the couches.

AMD (AMD) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings on Tuesday, meeting expectations on earnings per share and beating on revenue. But Wall Street wasn't too keen on the company's Q4 revenue outlook, which it said will come in between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion. Wall Street was looking for $7.55 billion. The chipmaker's stock fell more than 5% immediately following the announcement on fears of slowing artificial intelligence growth for the company. Despite that, CEO Lisa Su said demand for the company's offerings is strong. ""Looking forward, we see significant growth opportunities across our data center, client and embedded businesses driven by the insatiable demand for more compute,"" she said in a statement. For the quarter, AMD saw adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.8 billion.

news,2024-10-28 08:49:00,AMD gains as Northland says share gains likely to continue,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-gains-northland-says-share-124919344.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investing.com -- Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (NASDAQ:AMD) rose on Monday during pre-market trading after analysts at Northland Capital Markets said that they believe that the company will report revenue at or above the high end of its guidance for the third quarter in a note dated Monday. “We expect AMD to continue to gain a share in server CPUs and AI accelerators in CY25. Slowing earnings growth will likely be OPEX as AMD invests billions of dollars to capture tens of billions of future annual revenue,” the analysts said. The anticipated revenue increase is expected to boost AMD's bottom line, with non-GAAP earnings likely surpassing the consensus estimate of $0.92 per share. The analysts flagged AMD's ability to gain market share in the server CPU segment, a trend that has been bolstered by improvements in the enterprise market over the last three months. There are signs that demand for non-AI server products is also picking up, contributing to AMD's momentum in data center AI solutions. Northland expects AMD to guide for revenue above consensus for the fourth quarter, fueled by ongoing strength in its AI, server CPU, and client product lines. The analysts do not expect AMD to provide guidance for calendar year 2025 during the upcoming earnings report, which is anticipated in January 2025. However, they noted a sharp increase in AMD’s revenue share in the server market, rising from just 2% in 2019 to 34% in the first half of 2024. This growth has been attributed to AMD's competitive product offerings, which continue to outperform those of its main rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Additionally, early performance benchmarks suggest that AMD will maintain its upward trajectory in market share with the next generation of server CPUs expected to launch in 2025. AMD’s share in the AI accelerator market is also projected to grow, with estimates indicating an increase from 0.7% in 2023 to 3.9% in 2024. Analysts at Northland believe that AMD will continue to capture a larger slice of the accelerator market moving forward, especially as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces delays with its Blackwell product family. The expected release of AMD’s next-generation MI325x accelerators in early 2025 is expected to position the company well against NVIDIA's offerings, further solidifying its market presence. The shift toward AMD is partly driven by cloud service providers' (CSPs) desire for alternatives to NVIDIA, as indicated by year-over-year growth in AMD's AI revenue. Analysts at Northland estimate that AMD could potentially double its market share over the next two years, thanks to strategic partnerships with industry giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Hugging Face. Beyond 2025, Northland's projections suggest that AMD could generate between $18 billion and $28 billion in AI revenue by 2027, representing 6.2% to 9.7% of the AI accelerator market. The total revenue for AMD in 2027 could range from $45 billion to $55 billion, contingent on steady growth in its other product lines. Analysts estimate potential earnings power of $6 to $9 per share by that time, although operating expenses remain a major variable in these projections. While there are concerns regarding AMD's necessary investments to catch up with NVIDIA, Northland asserts that the company’s share gains against Intel demonstrate the long-term value of AMD's strategic investments.

Computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) will be reporting results tomorrow after the bell. Here’s what to expect. AMD beat analysts’ revenue expectations by 2% last quarter, reporting revenues of $5.84 billion, up 8.9% year on year. It was a strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and a significant improvement in its gross margin. Is AMD a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it’s free. This quarter, analysts are expecting AMD’s revenue to grow 15.8% year on year to $6.71 billion, improving from the 4.2% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.92 per share. The majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. AMD has only missed Wall Street’s revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 0.8% on average. Looking at AMD’s peers in the semiconductors segment, some have already reported their Q3 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. SMART’s revenues decreased 1.7% year on year, missing analysts’ expectations by 4.3%, and Micron Technology reported revenues up 93.3%, topping estimates by 1.4%. SMART’s stock price was unchanged after the results, while Micron Technology was up 14.6%. Read our full analysis of SMART’s results here and Micron Technology’s results here. Investors in the semiconductors segment have had fairly steady hands going into earnings, with share prices down 1.4% on average over the last month. AMD is down 4.8% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $188.06 (compared to the current share price of $156.15). Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

news,2024-10-27 22:33:00,Intel Stock Price Levels to Watch as Struggling Chipmaker's Earnings Loom,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/intel-stock-price-levels-as-struggling-chipmakers-earnings-loom-8735084," Intel (INTC) shares will be in focus this week as investors await the beleaguered chipmaker’s third quarter results after Thursday’s closing bell.
  Analysts expect the company to report a decline in revenue for the period owing to softening demand for both its PC and server chips as it faces intensifying competition from rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and artificial intelligence (AI) darling Nvidia (NVDA).
  Investors will look for further updates from executives about the company’s turnaround plans, which has helped underpin a 23% recovery in the chipmaker’s stock from its early-September low. However, the shares still remain more than 50% lower since the start of the year through Friday’s close, as the company’s dominance in the chip market continues to shrink.
  Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Intel’s weekly chart and point out important price levels to watch out for as the chipmaker prepares to report its quarterly results.
  Since breaking above the neckline of a double bottom on above-average volume last month, Intel shares have remained stuck in a sideways drift, with a doji forming last week—a candlestick pattern that indicates indecision.
  Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) has flattened out in recent weeks, confirming rangebound conditions in the stock.
  Amid the potential for earnings-driven volatility, let’s outline several important levels on Intel’s chart that investors will likely be watching.
  Firstly, it’s worth keep an eye on the $22 level. This area on the chart sits just 3% below Friday’s close and has provided support over the past month near the double bottom pattern’s neckline.
  A decisive breakdown below this region could see the chipmaker’s stock revisit the $19 level, an area where bargain hunters may look for buying opportunities near the August and September double bottom troughs.
  A breakout above the recent sideways drift may drive a move up to around $25. Investors who have purchased the stock at lower levels in recent months could seek exit points near three prominent swing lows that formed on the chart between October 2022 and February last year.
  A rally through this level could see the shares climb to $30, a location where the price may run into overhead selling pressure near major peaks and troughs on the chart from November 2022 through to June this year.
  Finally, a more bullish move may lead to a retest of the $36 level, an area just above the 50-week moving average where investors could decide to lock in profits near a trendline connecting a range of comparable trading levels on the chart between June 2022 and July this year.

news,2024-10-27 17:00:00,How a Mumbai Drugmaker Is Helping Putin Get Nvidia AI Chips,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mumbai-drugmaker-helping-putin-nvidia-210019312.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Occupying the top three floors of an unremarkable office building in northern Mumbai, there’s little to distinguish Shreya Life Sciences from the many other commercial businesses that keep the Andheri neighborhood of India’s largest metropolis humming throughout the day. Most Read from Bloomberg The Tartarian Candidate Booming Cambridge Exposes England’s Widening Wealth Gap A Courtyard Apartment Building Designed for Southwest Sprawl Robotaxis Are No Friend of Public Transportation Argentina Drug Trafficking Hotspot Sees Murders Plunge But this inconspicuous pharmaceutical company is part of a lucrative trade in leading-edge technology to Russia that has the US and its European allies worried at India’s burgeoning role as an intermediary in the sales. A Bloomberg News analysis of data compiled by trade-tracking firms ImportGenius and NBD shows that Shreya exported 1,111 units of Dell Technologies Inc.’s most-advanced servers to Russia in April-August of this year. The servers, known as PowerEdge XE9680, contain high-end processors optimized for artificial intelligence made by Nvidia Corp. or Advanced Micro Devices Inc., according to Dell’s website. Specification data available for 998 shipped servers show they were equipped with Nvidia’s H100 chips. The servers — and the chips they contain — are on a list of items restricted by the US and the European Union “to target sensitive sectors in Russia’s military industrial complex.” Yet the shipments, worth $300 million and imported by two Russian trading companies, Main Chain Ltd. and I.S LLC, were just the latest in a series of advanced technology exports Shreya made perfectly legally to Russia since September 2022, the data showed. Shreya did not respond to multiple requests for comment, and no one was available to do so during two visits to its office. The findings underscore the holes in western government attempts to shut off Moscow’s access to dual-use technology with potential military applications, as well as the cutting-edge nature of the equipment being shipped. India is increasingly the intermediary of choice: It’s now the second-biggest supplier after China of restricted technology to Russia, Bloomberg reported Oct. 12. Andriy Yermak, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, complained in a post on X that Russia is still receiving components used for electronic intelligence and warfare systems despite western sanctions. “No one should profit from the lives of Ukrainians,” he said Oct. 7. While India is the point of transshipment, trade data suggest that Malaysia is in fact the origin. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim met with President Vladimir Putin in Russia in September, and hailed the “enormous potential” to enhance regional trade relations, including through advanced technologies. Shipping documents of at least 834 PowerEdge XE9680 units destined for Russia showed their country of origin as Malaysia. Indian import data for March-August 2024 reveals that 1,407 of the same Dell units were imported to India from Malaysia. Neither Malaysia’s Investment, Trade and Industry Ministry nor the Prime Minister’s Office responded to an email seeking comments. The tech companies themselves are obligated to follow sanctions rules and monitor any sales of sensitive products. In a statement, Dell said that it had ceased selling and offering services or support for products in Russia in February 2022, immediately following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and maintains “a strict trade compliance program.” Nvidia and AMD said that they work with partners to ensure that sales are in “full compliance” with export controls, and take appropriate action if any violations are identified. Doing business with Russia is not illegal in India since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is not party to the multiple rounds of US and EU sanctions imposed on Moscow. Long dependent upon Russia for military equipment, New Delhi stepped in to buy its crude as European countries cut off oil imports over the war — and is signaling that it will continue to do so for as long as Moscow gives bigger discounts than other producers. During an Oct. 22 meeting with Putin on the sidelines of the BRICS summit, Modi referred to “our close and deepening” relations. That role has put India on the radar of western governments. US and EU officials have traveled to India in recent months as part of efforts to encourage the government to act to stop the shipments, according to people familiar with the trips. The visits come amid signs of mounting exasperation with India for its role procuring goods for Russia’s war. US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo sent a letter to the Confederation of Indian Industry this summer warning that foreign financial institutions trading with Russia’s military industrial base risked being sanctioned. Despite the Biden administration’s efforts to keep Modi’s government onside in its competition with China, New Delhi has shown little engagement with the US concerns, a senior US official said. Transshipment of battlefield products via India has ramped up since December of last year, according to David O’Sullivan, the EU’s chief sanctions official. In a briefing to reporters, he attributed the increase to “the huge volume of rupees” Russia has accrued from selling oil, rather than Indian policy. The EU has already sanctioned a few entities based in India. India has looked into US allegations and taken action as needed after Washington flagged that some Indian companies were supplying dual-use technology to Russia, said people familiar with the government’s stance, asking not to be named discussing sensitive matters of diplomacy. That matter is now closed, the people said, adding that Shreya Life Sciences did not feature on the list. A spokesperson for India’s Trade Ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. The Ministry of External Affairs declined to comment. India’s exports of controlled and dual-use goods and technologies are in full compliance with its national laws and regulations and its international obligations on non-proliferation, said a senior Indian official who asked not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Bloomberg has previously reported that the vast majority of restricted goods enter Russia via re-exports from third countries such as China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some of those trades involve often unwitting subsidiaries and subcontractors of western firms as well as networks of intermediaries who source from them. Information on those companies involved is rare — and the paper trail leading to Shreya is what makes the drugmaker stand out. The company was founded in Moscow in 1995 by Sujit Kumar Singh just as Russia was on the verge of economic breakdown, offering opportunities for enterprising individuals able to navigate the chaos of those years. Singh, the company’s CEO, was unavailable for comment despite email, telephone and text requests sent to Shreya. In an article for the Economic Times published in 2002, Singh wrote of Shreya’s initial role in developing a marketing and distribution network at a time when “after the collapse of the Soviet Union the pharmaceutical market was practically reduced to zero.” He also expressed hopes that a visit to India by Putin the same year would “impart a new impetus and greater depth and content to Indo-Russian relations.” Records from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs database show that Shreya began life as a distribution and marketing company of pharmaceutical drugs, over time acquiring several companies to create its own manufacturing plants for generic drugs like insulin, antibiotics, anti-malaria and gastrointestinal medicines. Indeed, between January 2022 and August 2024, it sold $22 million worth of pharmaceutical products to Russia, trade data shows. Russia is listed on the company website as the first among six major markets for its international exports. That dependence on Russia has proven to be a liability in the past. Shreya began seeing a dip in operating revenues in 2014-15 coinciding with Putin’s annexation of Crimea that led to sanctions and a collapse in the ruble, according to rating agency Crisil. As Shreya relied on sales of its drugs to Russian clients and to its own entity based in Moscow, Shreya Life Sciences LLC, the company began bleeding losses. The drugmaker defaulted on 1.9 billion rupees ($23 million) of bank loans in March 2015. While its bankers — including the State Bank of India and the LIC Housing Finance Ltd. — restructured its debt, the Bank of India Ltd. filed a suit against the company under the bankruptcy law in 2019, only to later withdraw the petition after the matter was settled out of court. Shreya returned to profitability in the following years. But the biggest lifeline for the Indian concern came from state-owned Promsvyazbank PJSC in Moscow. The bank’s head is Peter Fradkov, son of the former chief of Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, Mikhail Fradkov. Both the bank and Fradkov junior are subject to international sanctions. Between 2011 and 2013, Shreya borrowed $86 million from the Russian bank, in the form of a foreign currency loan which was mortgaged against shares owned by Sujit Kumar Singh. The money was used to invest in equity shares of Shreya Life Sciences LLC in Moscow, which in turn used the money to pay for the import of pharmaceutical products from the Indian entity. The loan effectively helped keep the company afloat as the drugmaker sold a significant amount of its products to its own subsidiary. Later, in 2018, as other financial institutions grew wary of tightening western sanctions, Russia turned the lender into the key funder of its defense industry. Throughout that time, the bank seems to have allowed Shreya to defer its repayments consistently, as cash flow payments toward its borrowings were a fraction of what was due. As of 2022-23, the company had 7.6 billion rupees in borrowings of which 85% is owed to Promsvyazbank. An email to the bank seeking comment went unanswered. Meantime, local drug inspectors found deficiencies in insulin injections manufactured by Shreya in 2019, while its products were found to be “not of standard quality” most recently in April by the Central Drug Laboratory in Kolkata. It’s against this backdrop that Shreya began branching out into technology shipments. The first record of non-medical exports by Shreya during the period examined by Bloomberg appeared in September 2022, when it shipped an assortment of computer hardware to Russia worth $755,333. The recipient was Lanprint Ltd., a Russian trading company which was later added to the US sanctioned company list, in September 2023. It sold equipment to another company, Silkway LLC, which was sanctioned the same month. Shreya stopped dealing with both companies two months before they were sanctioned and started selling to Main Chain, which is not on the US list of sanctioned entities. Main Chain was registered as a company in Russia on Jan. 25, 2023, with Anastasia Obukhova its general director. She is listed on a Russian business portal as holding the same post for two previous companies, a tourism agency and a tour operator, both of which were liquidated. Each had declared capital of 10,000 rubles (about $130-$200), so Main Chain is a considerable step up. The company states on its website that it “imports and wholesales computer equipment from various foreign manufacturers.” An email and calls to Main Chain went unanswered. Shreya’s exports to Main Chain and I. S surged in April this year, when it ramped up sales of Dell’s PowerEdge XE9680 at an average price of $260,000. These servers come under HS code 847150, part of the dual-use goods list that aims to curb the Russian weapons systems used against Ukraine. The list, drawn up by the EU in conjunction with the US, the UK and Japan, is based partly on tech identified on the battlefield. Shipping documents show the imports were ordered from Malaysia by Dell International Services India Private Ltd., a Dell subsidiary, and the supplier was recorded as Dell Global BV (Singapore Branch), another subsidiary. Dell said it requires distributors and resellers “to follow all applicable global regulations and export controls,” and invests in tools and resources to help prevent and detect potential product diversion. “If a partner is not adhering to these obligations, we take swift and appropriate action, up to and including termination of our relationship,” the company said. Main Chain sourced technology products from a second Indian company, Hayers Infotech Private Limited. Together, Shreya and Hayers Infotech exported $434 million worth of high-tech goods to Russia since February 2022. Hayers Infotech is registered at the same Mumbai address as Shreya Life Sciences.

news,2024-10-27 05:00:00,What You Need To Know Ahead of AMD's Earnings,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/amd-q3-fy-2024-earnings-preview-8734279,"Bloomberg / Contributor / Getty Images  UPDATE—Oct. 29, 2024: This article has been updated to reflect more recent share price information.
  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) will report third-quarter financial results after the closing bell Tuesday, with analysts calling for significant earnings growth.
  Analysts expect the chipmaker to report revenue of $6.71 billion, up nearly 16% year-over-year, according to Visible Alpha. Net income is projected to be $815.76 million or 50 cents per share, more than double the $299 million or 18 cents per share AMD posted a year earlier.
  In July, AMD reported data center revenue in the second quarter more than doubled year-over-year to a record $2.8 billion, as demand for the company's artificial intelligence (AI) chips surged.
  Analysts expect data center revenue to rise to a fresh high of $3.52 billion for the third quarter. CEO Lisa Su said in July that AMD expects to “deliver strong revenue growth in the second half of the year led by demand for Instinct, EPYC and Ryzen processors."" 
  At the company’s Advancing AI event earlier this month, AMD launched its next generation of AI chips but did not raise its AI sales guidance or announce any new large customers as many investors had hoped. Jefferies analysts suggested investors could be watching for those updates to come with AMD's earnings Tuesday.
  Over 80% or 13 of the 16 analysts covering AMD tracked by Visible Alpha have a ""buy"" or equivalent rating for the stock, with an average price target of $192.13, implying close to 18% upside from Tuesday's intraday price of $163.35. Shares of AMD have gained about 11% so far in 2024.

The move is in sympathy with Western Digital Corp’s (NASDAQ:WDC) rally following its upbeat quarterly print. On Thursday, Western Digital reported first-quarter EPS of $1.78, which beat the analyst consensus of $1.73. Quarterly revenue of $4.09 billion trailed the consensus estimate of $4.12 billion compared to $2.75 billion a year ago.

KeyBanc analyst John Vinh recently flagged mixed performance in the semiconductor supply chain, revising several estimates and price targets. Despite weak analog markets, he cited signs of recovery in automotive and robust demand in traditional servers and AI, with Nvidia’s Blackwell launch on track for the fourth quarter. Vinh downgraded Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Synaptics Inc (NASDAQ:SYNA) to Sector Weight, pointing to Qualcomm’s market share loss to MediaTek due to price competition and Synaptics’ challenges in IoT against local competitor HiSilicon. He highlighted Nvidia and AMD positively for their robust AI and server demand, whereas Micron, Monolithic Power, Marvell, and Intel face headwinds from market share losses and intensifying competition. Equity research can be a valuable source of information for learning about a company's fundamentals. Analysts create financial models based on the fundamentals and expected future earnings of a company to arrive at a price target and recommendation for the stock. Shares of Western Digital have an average 1-year price target of $92.07, representing an expected upside of 27.01%.

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. It’s no secret that computer gaming chipmaker turned artificial intelligence wunderkind Nvidia (NVDA) has had a fantastic year, but the party may have just begun for investors. “The revenue monetization opportunity is so much greater [than investors appreciate],” Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). “They really are a system integrator at this point,” Arya added. “They’re selling complete racks with all the computing, the networking, the optical resources, the memory, everything thrown in.” The top semiconductor analyst just made a few waves in the market with his latest call on Nvidia. He lifted his earnings per share estimates for 2024 and 2025, citing likely strong demand for its new Blackwell chip. Demand for Nvidia's prior AI chip — Hopper — remains hot, Arya said. Given this, Nvidia's stock is still cheap trading on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 37 times, per Arya.   With the company poised to haul in a whopping $200 billion in free cash flow the next two years, Arya said the stock looks cheap on a price-to-cash flow basis too. Arya sees at least 40% more upside in Nvidia's stock. Shares are already up 190% year to date and hovering near records amid an 18% surge in October. Rival AMD's stock (AMD) is only up 5% on the year, as the performance specs on the company's AI chip released a few weeks ago disappointed investors. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) continues to slog through one of the worst periods in its existence, dominated by layoffs and inferior products. Shares have plunged 55% this year. Key drivers for Arya's bullish Nvidia call (alongside less bullish views on Intel) include coming next-generation AI chips — Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra. Those offerings will begin hitting the market in Q3 2025 based on Arya's analysis. “Everyone is in a race,” Arya said about the country's AI infrastructure buildout. Arya envisions a scenario where OpenAI and companies like Meta (META) drive the market with open structures and cloud companies act as go-betweens. That only drives more need for Nvidia's best in class chips. It's a demand backdrop that is real and lasting, C3.ai (AI) CEO Tom Siebel said on Opening Bid.
