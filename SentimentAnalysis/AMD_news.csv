  The company, which makes chip-based connectivity products to boost the efficiency of AI, reported quarterly revenue of $113.1 million, up 47% from the prior quarter and 206% year-over-year, while showing a net loss of $7.6 million, or 5 cents a share.
  It also forecast fourth-quarter revenue of between $126 million and $130 million and earnings per share between 4 cents to 6 cents.
  Astera, which went public in March, said in its initial public offering (IPO) filing that its customers include several key players in the AI space. Apart from Nvidia, they include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC).
  In a note released Monday, Jeffferies analysts said the company ""looks to be firing on all cylinders heading into 2025.""
  ""Lots to love about this report with strength across a combination of products with demand from both NVDA and multiple AI ASIC platforms (likely AMZN & GOOG),"" the broker said. Jefferies has given the stock a buy rating with a $69.65 price target.
  An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) is a custom-designed chip built for a specific use or application. 
  Astera shares are up about 71% so far for the year.

news,2024-11-05 08:55:00,"Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, and Incomprehensible: Welcome to the BANI world",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brittle-anxious-nonlinear-incomprehensible-welcome-135535051.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Welcome to the BANI world—Brittle, Anxious, Nonlinear, and Incomprehensible. This new paradigm has replaced the familiar VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) framework. The shift from VUCA to BANI is evident in three key areas. First, the speed of change has accelerated dramatically. While VUCA acknowledged constant change, BANI recognizes the increased velocity of change. Second, BANI acknowledges the complexity created by the interconnectedness of our global systems. In a deeply intertwined world, risks are nonlinear and contagious in ways that are often unpredictable. Finally, the emotional impact of change has intensified. BANI highlights the widespread anxiety and polarization of our era, in which responses can accelerate crises. In September 2024, Tupperware Brands, once a symbol of American ingenuity and household organization, filed for bankruptcy protection. The collapse of this iconic brand, which had thrived for more than 70 years, is a fundamental reminder of how quickly established businesses can crumble in today’s precarious environment. Amongst the reasons Tupperware cited for its decline include the challenging macroeconomic environment and changing customer preferences. However, the company’s continued reliance on a direct sales model that had been effective in the 20th century instead of developing an e-commerce strategy and infrastructure was its fatal flaw. On the other hand, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), once on the brink of extinction, underwent a remarkable change under Lisa Su's leadership. AMD made bold strategic moves to reposition itself and benefit from the industry’s growth: Competitive pricing, improved performance, more comprehensive open-source firmware support, and better compatibility expanded its market share, taking AMD from near bankruptcy to major player in the computer business in a decade. In addition, big bets on AI PCs have positioned the company to compete with Nvidia and Intel in attracting new customers seeking a single-vendor solution. Success in the BANI world demands a top-to-bottom transformation of corporate leadership and governance. A crucial element of this transformation is the need for Boards, CEOs, and C-Suite executives to reassess the composition and responsibilities of their respective roles. We propose a five-part framework for this radical shift. Redefining the Board: To provide effective oversight, Boards must recognize the value of every seat at the table. Successfully navigating complex, nonlinear challenges requires a broader definition of diversity to include experiential and cognitive diversity and the goal of true inclusion. Term limits, performance evaluations, and commitment to continuous learning are fundamental to the Board’s ability to stay ahead of rapid changes. And a BANI world requires oversight of corporate strategy to evolve from an annual exercise to a standing agenda item at meetings that include internal and external experts as needed. The New CEO: The ideal CEO profile has changed dramatically in the BANI world. Adaptive leadership – the ability to navigate constant change and ambiguity with agility and resilience – is now paramount. This adaptability must be coupled with technological fluency, not just a surface-level understanding of tech trends, but the ability to leverage that knowledge strategically to drive business growth and innovation. Moreover, the modern CEO must excel in stakeholder management, skillfully balancing the often-conflicting demands of shareholders, employees, customers, and regulators. Reimagining the C-Suite: The C-suite, once a collection of siloed experts, must be reimagined as a collaborative, cross-functional team to drive agility and innovation. This change requires a focus on cross-pollination of ideas, encouraging executives to work outside their traditional domains and bringing fresh perspectives to challenges. Rapid experimentation should be at the core of C-suite operations, fostering a culture of iterative learning that can keep pace with the nonlinear nature of the BANI world. In addition, data-driven decision-making must become the norm, leveraging AI and analytics for real-time insights. AI Integration: Artificial Intelligence represents a fundamental reshaping of how businesses operate. Organizations should approach AI integration strategically, beginning with efficiency and experience enhancements, then leveraging AI for customer loyalty and expansion, and finally exploring AI-driven opportunities in adjacent markets and new business models. Measuring Success: In tandem with AI integration, organizations must redefine their performance metrics for the BANI world taking a more holistic approach that focuses on long-term value creation through three-to-five-year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) rather than quarterly results. This approach should be complemented by stakeholder capitalism, measuring impact across all stakeholders, not just shareholders. Adaptive performance monitoring, with flexible KPIs that can evolve with changing circumstances, is crucial in navigating the nonlinear aspects of the BANI environment. The BANI world doesn't allow for piecemeal changes or drawn-out decision-making. Organizations need a bold approach that touches every aspect of governance and leadership. This includes a clear-eyed assessment of BANI readiness, reimagining board composition and processes, developing new criteria for selecting and evaluating top leaders, fostering a culture of adaptive innovation, creating a comprehensive AI roadmap, redefining success metrics, and adopting proactive, transparent stakeholder communication. The challenges of the BANI world are formidable—but so are the opportunities. Organizations that recognize this new reality and embrace comprehensive change will be best positioned to thrive. The choice is clear: adapt holistically or risk becoming another cautionary tale. The time for incremental change has passed. For Boards, CEOs, and C-Suites, it’s now or never.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence is a game changer. According to a PwC report, it could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Of this, $6.6 trillion is likely to come from increased productivity while $9.1 trillion is from consumption-side effects. The report also reveals that global GDP will be up to 14% higher in 2030 due to the accelerating development of AI. The greatest productivity gains are likely to go to North America and China, with the former expected to realize the AI benefits faster.

However, the surge in artificial intelligence will require a huge number of data centers, and it is significantly going to impact how much the world consumes power, and how much that is going to cost. To have an idea, on average, a ChatGPT search needs as much as 10 times more electricity to process as a Google search. That said, AI gathering steam is only going to make the power hunger crazier. According to estimates from Goldman Sachs, the data center demand is going to grow 160% by 2030. Presently, data centers consume about 1-2% of overall power, but the percentage is likely to rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade. As we examine the increasing energy demand of data centers stemming from the surge in AI, it’s worth noting how these advancements are manifesting in practical applications.

The Claude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval), demonstrating marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural and relatable tone. Another exciting news is how Runway, an AI company shaping the next era of art, entertainment, and human creativity, has launched a new set of advanced AI camera controls for its Gen-3 Alpha Turbo video generation model. These tools allow the user generating videos from text prompts, upload images, or even their footage, to have greater control over the AI-generated settings and characters. Users can even zoom in or out of the scene and subjects without disrupting their realism, creating a more immersive experience of a seemingly 3D world. In other news, a highly anticipated release that many have been waiting on is seemingly delayed, as per the latest reports. On Thursday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that his company’s next big model won’t likely be released this year. According to Altman, the company is ""prioritizing"" shipping existing models focused on reasoning and difficult questions. “All of these models have gotten quite complex and we can’t ship as many things in parallel as we’d like to”. He said the company faces “limitations and hard decisions” when it comes to allocating compute resources “towards many great ideas.” - Altman wrote during a Reddit AMA. When asked about the release of ChatGPT-5, Altman stated that the company has some very good releases this year but “nothing that we are going to call GPT-5.” Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Investing.com -- Hyperscalers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) reported their third-quarter financial results last week and, with the numbers, also provided updates on their Capex spending plans amid the ongoing AI boom. The numbers and growth are impressive, to say the least. Morgan Stanley internet analyst Brian Nowak highlighted that they now see 2025 capex for the hyperscalers reaching over $300 billion, up 25% from 2024 and nearly double 2023. As a result, the analyst raised their 2025 capex estimates by 9%. The biggest spenders will be Amazon and Microsoft, spending $96.4 billion and $89.9 billion, respectively.

Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently delved into the complexities of disappointing quarterly earnings, emphasizing the importance of transparent communication from management. He pointed out that during each earnings season, evaluating companies can vary significantly in difficulty. Cramer remarked that when grading these results, investors seek clarity and simplicity, wanting reports that are easy to understand rather than muddled and confusing. Last Wednesday, Cramer posed a thought-provoking question, noting that while stocks have the potential to generate substantial profits, the recent earnings reports have made it clear that not all results are straightforward. “Stocks can make you a lot of money, can't they? But after another day full of earnings where the Dow fell 92 points, S&P dipped 0.33% and Nasdaq declined 0.56%, it is worth remembering that most of these quarterly report cards aren't that clean, not that simple.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks Cramer likened the reporting process to navigating a complicated landscape where quick, headline-driven summaries often fail to capture essential nuances, which can lead to significant misunderstandings and even crises in interpretation. He explained that many companies faced a series of challenges in their earnings reports, asserting that every disappointing quarter has its unique characteristics, complicating the assessment process. Cramer illustrated this by comparing the situation to a criminal trial, where a defendant who is clearly guilty but refuses a plea deal might face severe consequences. He emphasized that for CEOs, acknowledging mistakes is crucial; failing to address poor results could lead to a perception that they do not take the reporting process seriously. “Bottom line, memo to CEOs everywhere: each gutter ball, every strike out, must be explained or we’ll be concerned that you simply don’t take the process seriously. If you don’t want to face the music, then you need to give us the happy family of good results and a sunny forecast. When you can't do that, you at least need to straightforwardly admit that you were wrong.” Jim Cramer is Talking About These 7 Stocks Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on October 30. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31 Cramer commented that one of his favorites, Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ:WING) did not report its usual solid quarterly earnings. Here’s what he said about the results and the reaction of the market to them: “Finally, there are the unhappiest of shortfalls, the ones that management simply refuses to acknowledge, either because they're in a state of denial or they're full of it. And that's what I thought as I read the conference call for Wingstop… one of my favorites. Every quarter they give you an Acme dynamite set of earnings and a rosy forecast, sensational same-store sales. Today though, Wingstop dwelled on the good, not blowout, same-store sales and didn't even mention the out and out earnings shortfall. 88 cents, looking for 96. Funny thing about Wall Street, the only thing it hates more than a big miss is when management tries to pretend the big miss didn't happen. Hence why Wingstop plunged 21% today.” Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) is a restaurant franchise that operates under the Wingstop brand, specializing in classic and boneless wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches, all hand-sauced and tossed in a variety of flavors. The company promotes itself as ""The Wing Experts"" and employs an asset-light franchise model. As of September 28, the company has established a presence with 2,458 restaurants globally, including 2,120 locations in the United States. Of these, 2,064 are franchised, while 56 are company-owned. Internationally, there are 338 franchised restaurants in various markets. For the fiscal third quarter, the company reported revenue of $162.5 million, marking a significant increase from $117.1 million the previous year, a growth of 38.8%. The net income for the same period reached $25.7 million, a rise of 31.9% and diluted EPS stood at $0.88. The company's system-wide sales also saw a considerable boost, rising by 39.4% to $1.2 billion. Despite these impressive figures, rising input costs, particularly related to bone-in chicken wings, led to an increased cost of sales, which reached 77.8%. On October 31, BMO Capital lowered the price target on Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) to $335 from $360 and maintained a Market Perform rating. As per the firm, the company's third-quarter earnings per share fell short of expectations due to slightly weaker comparable store sales, diminished restaurant margins, and increased general and administrative costs. The firm added that although the current business momentum for the company remains strong and its long-term outlook is positive, concerns about decelerating comparable sales may impact share performance until there is clearer stabilization in the market. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 39 Cramer commended Reddit, Inc.'s (NYSE:RDDT) third-quarter results and credited the stock gaining to its “profitable quarter”. “Ideally, we hope for companies like Reddit, our guest last night. Wall Street was expecting it to be a money loser with little growth. Instead, we got a highly profitable quarter with a modest growth. And that's why the stock’s soared 42%.” Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) operates a dynamic platform that fosters the creation and engagement of digital communities centered around diverse interests, allowing users to participate in discussions and share various types of content. The company reported its Q3 results on October 29 and the stock has been up over 38% since then, as of November 1. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations by reporting earnings that showed substantial growth. It achieved revenue of $348 million, which showed a remarkable year-over-year increase of 68%. This performance resulted in a positive earnings per diluted share of $0.16, a significant turnaround from a previous net loss of $0.13. User engagement on Reddit has also seen considerable growth, with active user counts increasing by 51% in the U.S. and 44% in international markets. Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) management attributed this surge in part to advancements in machine translation, which has led to four times the incremental growth in daily users. The company plans to extend this technology to additional countries, which is expected to further drive user engagement. Additionally, the average revenue per user (ARPU) grew by 14% globally, contributing to a 56% boost in worldwide advertising sales, which remains the primary driver of the company's growth. In a notable development, the company's smaller revenue category, labeled ""other revenue,"" experienced a dramatic increase of 547%, primarily fueled by the expansion of its artificial intelligence business. This segment includes data licensing partnerships that have become increasingly significant. During the earnings call, COO Jen Wong highlighted that the company licenses its user data to facilitate advertising analytics and to assist in training large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 100 On Wednesday, talking about his favorite, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY), Cramer expressed disappointment with the company’s recent earnings report. Here’s what Mad Money’s host had to say: “Then there's Cramer fave, Eli Lilly. Here's the stock that's been almost as hot as Nvidia. It's up 45% for the year, even after today's hideous 6.2% collapse. Given how much Lilly had run into the quarter, we needed to see some extraordinary numbers from the revolutionary GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight loss, right?... And we also needed them to raise their forecast dramatically, but we got nothing like that. Instead, Lily reported a clear miss, a real whiff. And the explanation for it was totally opaque. I'm still trying to figure out what the heck happened. Was it too much supply? Too little demand? Stock finished about $56. One point, it was down a hundred. Talk about an unhappy forecast.” Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is a prominent global pharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming diabetes care and addressing obesity and its serious long-term effects. A shining star in its product line is Zepbound, a new treatment for obesity that activates specific hormone receptors, offering a fresh approach in this therapeutic area. Another significant product is Mounjaro, the first approved medication for type 2 diabetes targeting these same receptors, utilizing tirzepatide as its active ingredient. These medications, also known as GLP-1 agonists, function by activating receptors for hormones released after eating, helping individuals feel fuller. In the third quarter, the company reported sales of $11.44 billion. The company noted that U.S. sales for both Mounjaro and Zepbound were adversely affected by a decrease in inventories within the wholesaler channel. During the Q3 earnings call, CFO Lucas Montarce explained that wholesalers had reduced their inventories of diabetes and obesity drugs during the quarter, describing it as a temporary issue. He emphasized that demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound remains strong and continues to grow. CEO David Ricks also highlighted a 25% increase in U.S. prescription volume for these medications from the second to the third quarter. For 2024, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) anticipates a non-GAAP EPS between $13.02 and $13.52, having previously forecast a full-year non-GAAP EPS of $16.10 to $16.60. This adjustment is primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic Holdings, which impacted in-process research and development charges by $3.09 billion, or $3.33 per share. For the third quarter, these charges amounted to $2.83 billion, or $3.08 per share, mainly associated with the Morphic Holdings acquisition. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Cramer remarked that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) performed well enough in its third quarter but not exceptionally well while highlighting the company’s difficulties with supply chain constraints. “Now, we're trying to buy it for my Charitable Trust. Last night, AMD reported an extraordinary quarter, numbers I could never have imagined a year ago, two years ago. Back then, I would've thought that making $2 billion in artificial intelligence chips would be incredible and now it looks like they’ll do $5 billion. But traders don't care about the quarter, that's now in the rearview mirror. Do they? They care about the next quarter and the next 12 months for that matter. And on that basis, AMD did well, but not well enough. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a prominent player in the semiconductor sector, recognized for its innovative processors and graphics solutions that cater to a wide range of applications, including personal computers and data centers. Competing with major companies like Intel and Nvidia, it operates through key business segments such as Client, Data Center, Gaming, and Embedded, with a strong emphasis on high-performance and adaptive computing technologies. It should be noted that during the earnings call, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) CEO Lisa Su discussed the ongoing challenges in the supply chain environment, commenting that the company has effectively managed its capacity. She acknowledged that while supply tightness is expected to persist in the upcoming quarters, the company has outlined plans for significant growth heading into 2025. For the fourth quarter, the company expects revenue to be around $7.5 billion, with a possible variance of $300 million, indicating a projected growth of 22% at the midpoint. Additionally, the company has revised its full-year GPU data center revenue forecast from over $4.5 billion to now exceeding $5 billion. Looking toward 2025, the company remains optimistic about continued growth in the data center segment, driven by substantial investments from companies aiming to expand their infrastructure for AI workloads. The company also mentioned that customers are increasingly diversifying the workloads they run on its GPUs. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 216 During last Wednesday's Mad Money episode, Cramer acknowledged that he did not have many expectations from Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) previously but highlighted that its recent quarterly earnings report reminded him of the “old Google”. “Alphabet defines the happy beat and raise. This stock had been the laggard in the Mag 7. Nobody expected much from it at all, I didn't. I mean we own it for the trust, but I didn't. The company has a really bad habit of giving you a muddled message even when it's doing well. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) provides a wide range of products and services through its segments, including advertising, cloud services, communication tools, and various platforms like YouTube and Google Play, catering to both consumer and enterprise needs. As per Statcounter Global Stats, Google Search holds the primary position among search engines as its market share is 89.33%. In the third quarter, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud achieved significant revenue growth of 35%, reaching $11.4 billion. The company noted that customers are increasingly adopting its AI platform for building and customizing models, with the Gemini model gaining notable popularity. Management highlighted the success of its data platform BigQuery, alongside AI-driven cybersecurity solutions like Google Threat Intelligence and Security Operations, which have expanded the company's application portfolio. In addition to cloud services, Google Search has also shown strong performance, with revenue rising over 12% to more than $49 billion. The company noted particular strength among financial services providers, including insurance companies, and retailers. AI capabilities are helping the company gain deeper insights into user behavior, allowing for better connections between users and advertisers. Meanwhile, YouTube has achieved significant milestones, with total ad and subscription revenues exceeding $50 billion over the past four quarters for the first time, driven by offerings such as YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket, and YouTube Music Premium. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Cramer delved into Meta Platforms, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:META) third-quarter earnings report that was released on October 30. Here’s what he had to say about it: “Meta stock instantly plunged about 20 bucks when it reported because there was no beat and raise lingo. Remember we like that stuff spoon-fed because we're lazy. I had to bat this one around for a while with the crew because there are puts and takes to the guidance. That's another technical term, puts and takes… And I still can't be sure that it should be down so much. It's coining money for heaven's sake. Again, hard to pin down. A non-beaten, non raiser that made the numbers.” Meta (NASDAQ:META) is a global leader in connecting people through a variety of products that allow for sharing and interaction on mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. The company boasts an audience of 3.29 billion daily active users across its platforms. The majority of its revenue comes from selling advertising space to businesses looking to reach this extensive audience. As users engage more with platforms like Facebook and Instagram, the number of advertisements they encounter increases, driving revenue growth. In Q3, Meta’s (NASDAQ:META) advertising revenue climbed nearly 19%, totaling $39.9 billion. The company has projected its fourth-quarter revenue between $45 billion and $48 billion. Additionally, a notable rise in capital expenditures is expected in 2025, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized the importance of investing in artificial intelligence and infrastructure for future growth. Management mentioned that AI plays a crucial role in boosting user engagement and time spent on its platforms, while also providing tools for advertisers to improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and boost conversion rates. The company highlighted advancements in its Llama large language model, which has seen significant growth in tokens, aiding in AI computations. Training for Llama 4 is currently underway, utilizing a cluster that is bigger than 100,000 H100 graphic processing units. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Talking about Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) solid quarter during last Wednesday’s episode, Cramer highlighted the company surpassing the estimates and advised to focus on the forward guidance. “Microsoft traded up initially on the strength of the results for the reporting quarter, including a top and bottom line beat, plus, much better than expected growth for its Azure cloud computing business. It grew 33%, Wall Street's looking for 29 and 12 points of that growth came from the company's AI offerings. That said, anyone trading Microsoft now's being reckless. As I told you, many times, many times the success of each Microsoft quarter is usually determined by the company's forward guidance, which they don't give us until… the conference call that's going on right now.” Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a leading technology company that develops and supports a wide range of software, services, devices, and solutions. Its portfolio includes productivity applications, business solutions, cloud services, operating systems, hardware, and gaming products. According to IBISWorld, the company has a noteworthy market share in around 18 industries. It holds the largest market share in the Database, Storage, and Backup Software Publishing industry, representing approximately 56.0% of the total revenue in this sector. For fiscal Q2 2025, the company’s management expects growth for its Azure cloud services to range between 31% and 32%, marking a deceleration from the previous quarter's 34% growth rate. Overall, revenue for the Intelligent Cloud segment is projected to increase by 18% to 20% year over year. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) management projected that sales from AI-related products are expected to remain consistent with last quarter's performance. The company is optimistic about Azure's potential to accelerate in the latter half of the fiscal year, driven by new investments in data center capacity that are set to come online. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Following through with a shift in its business strategy from the gaming industry, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financial) has aimed to capture the fast-growing AI market by confirming the RDNA 4 GPUs for early 2025. In a Q3 2024 earnings call, AMD CEO Lisa Su stated that the company will soon release these new GPUs, which will offer improved gaming performance, and will feature better ray tracing and new AI features. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMD. It also signals a change in focus by AMD from mainly using its products to drive gaming hardware to concentrate on AI endeavours, an overall trend among several segments of the computer industry for high-performance AI applications. It is seen as a direct follow-up to the changing requirements of AMD's now predominant data center customer base, which accounts for more than 50% of its overall revenues. Su also pointed to how games, contributing to only 2% of AMD's overall revenues, are now a much lesser concern for the company as the mainstream focus shifts towards AI technologies. The next RDNA 4 series may be launched at CES 2025, combined with the growth of other products, such as the Ryzen Z2 handheld gaming chips and gaming notebook parts. Of course, this lineup shows that AMD stays in the gaming market, but it is not its priority. This way, AMD would become one of the market leaders in the AI sector and leave the market battle with Nvidia's prime GPUs for consumers behind. The shift to focus on AI and data centers is to tap into the high-growth areas where AMD will place the firm as a leading and strategic provider of AI solutions in the technology sector.

news,2024-11-04 09:00:00,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-140016493.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this chipmaker have returned -17% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.4% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has lost 5.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share, indicating a change of +37.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -6.2% over the last 30 days. The consensus earnings estimate of $3.30 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +24.5%. This estimate has changed -1.2% over the last 30 days. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.91 indicates a change of +48.6% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.5%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Advanced Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.51 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +21.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $25.66 billion and $32.33 billion estimates indicate +13.2% and +26% changes, respectively. Advanced Micro reported revenues of $6.82 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.6%. EPS of $0.92 for the same period compares with $0.70 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.71 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +1.1%. Over the last four quarters, Advanced Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Advanced Micro is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Advanced Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Investors aren't impressed by the weakness in non-AI segments as well as a lower-than-expected guidance. We believe the stock is worth taking a deeper look at, especially with AI infrastructure investments continuing to dominate Big Tech spending. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), an American fabless semiconductor company, conceptualizes, develops, and sells computer processors and related technologies for diverse markets, from consumer to business. Founded in 1968 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the company gained a dominant market position due to its cutting-edge computing and graphics technologies, coupled with the transition to a fabless structural model that initiates outsourcing manufacturing to an external party such as GlobalFoundries. AMD deals in a variety of products, namely microprocessors, graphics processors, motherboard chipsets, Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), Accelerated Processing Units (APUs), and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In a recent development, AMD disclosed its “Zen 5” Ryzen processors for an Advanced AI experience. Although CPUs and GPUs are the major revenue drivers, over the years, the enterprise range has witnessed growing demand stemming from data centers and cloud computing growth. AMD reported an impressive $5.8 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2024, with a gross margin of 49%. The third quarter also beat analyst estimates, with the revenue coming in at $6.8 billion, powered by AI revenue. The primary clients of AMD include key technology companies, PC manufacturers like Dell and HP, and gaming console makers, particularly Sony (PlayStation) and Microsoft (Xbox). AMD serves a range of end markets, including personal computing, data centers, embedded systems, gaming, and robustly performing computing applications. It is the data center market that we will focus on. AMD reported a staggering 122% growth in the Data Center segment. The growth has come both from sales of EPYC CPUs and AMD Instinct GPUs. AMD is expected to continue to face inconsistent and cyclical AI spending from its primary clients. However, over a longer duration of time, this should not bother investors. Estimates put the total AI spending for the rest of the decade at over $500 billion. While AMD is no Nvidia, it is still a dominant market player and stands to benefit from this spending. For the above reason, the weakness in the gaming segment (69% YoY decline) and the Embedded segment (25% YoY decline) shouldn't worry investors. The company needs to divert its energy to the segment that is growing the fastest. AI is a fast developing technology and AMD wants to strike while the iron is hot. This might sound like a short-term focus for AMD, but controlling the market in the short term is what will put AMD at the center of other businesses's AI infrastructure. Once that happens, future revenue will eventually trickle down to the bottom line. For us, the 'poor' earnings report is a buying opportunity! AMD ranks 18th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 108 hedge fund portfolios held AMD at the end of the second quarter which was 124 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares are trading lower by 14% to $142.44 since Wednesday’s open after the company reported third-quarter results. The company posted revenue of $6.8 billion, which exceeded analyst expectations of $6.71 billion. Earnings per share aligned with projections at 92 cents. What To Know: AMD’s data center segment was the driving force behind the company’s growth, achieving a 122% increase to $3.5 billion. The company also saw a 29% rise in client segment revenue, totaling $1.9 billion. However, gaming revenue experienced a steep decline of 69% to $462 million, and embedded revenue fell 25% to $927 million, though embedded revenue saw an 8% sequential quarterly increase.

CEO Lisa Su attributed AMD's results to high demand for the company's EPYC and Instinct data center products, as well as Ryzen processors in the PC segment. She also projected further growth opportunities across data center, client and embedded business sectors, driven by escalating demand for computing power. Looking ahead, AMD forecasts fourth-quarter revenue of $7.5 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Adjusted gross margins for the fourth-quarter are expected to remain consistent at 54%.

Analyst Reactions: The company's expansion in artificial intelligence (AI) and data center solutions has drawn positive reactions from analysts, who suggest AMD could increasingly challenge its main competitor, NVIDIA, in the AI domain. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh noted the importance of AMD's MI300 chip, which is projected to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2024. Vinh believes that this chip could broaden customer adoption across cloud and AI applications, despite conservative fourth quarter guidance. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse pointed out that AMD's AI progress with the MI300 may eventually generate $12 billion in revenue, supporting potential earnings growth by 2025 or 2026, even though he anticipates a short-term trading range for AMD shares. Other analysts provided mixed assessments. Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer commended AMD's rapid establishment of a competitive AI franchise, projected to surpass $5 billion in annual revenue, though he suggested that investor expectations might be overly ambitious. Meanwhile, Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar highlighted strong GPU execution but acknowledged challenging guidance, noting that while AMD's GPU and server segments are promising, gaming and embedded segments pose risks.

(NASDAQ:INTC) has a Gaudi problem on its hands – the chipmaker revealed that its AI accelerator won't even make $500 million in 2024, falling short of CEO Pat Gelsinger's target of $1 billion to $2 billion. What Happened: Gelsinger revealed during Intel's third-quarter earnings call that the Gaudi AI accelerator program will fall short of revenue targets due to a transition from second to third generation. ""The overall uptake of Gaudi has been slower than we anticipated as adoption rates were impacted by the product transition from Gaudi 2 to Gaudi 3 and software ease of use,"" Gelsinger said.

On the other hand, 2022 and 2023 were both lukewarm for AMD, but it started gathering pace in the fourth quarter of 2023.

news,2024-11-01 14:09:00,"Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Stock Got Slammed In The After-hours Trading",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-advanced-micro-devices-180914615.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, expressed concerns about the impact of rising bond yields on the stock market, suggesting that this trend could restrict the recent tech rally and limit broader sector gains. On Tuesday, he remarked that the bond market is creating significant disruptions, stating: “Bonds are wrecking the narrative, driving the people outta everything that works when the Fed cuts rates and they're going right back into tech. That's the opposite of what, if you're a true bull, you want to see.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 20 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch Despite the Dow experiencing a modest decline of 155 points, the S&P 500 managed a slight increase of 0.16%, while the NASDAQ achieved a record close with a 0.78% rise on Tuesday. Cramer pointed out that the market is becoming increasingly narrow and exclusive, primarily benefiting tech stocks at the expense of broader participation, which he considers unhealthy. Cramer explained that this trend was somewhat anticipated. He recounted how, when news broke about the Fed potentially implementing a 50 basis point rate cut, there was a surge of enthusiasm among investors who began buying bonds. They were betting on a series of rapid rate cuts, leading to expectations that bond yields would fall. Cramer noted, “It seemed a total legit thing, right? I mean the economy was slowing, that's been the pattern historically.” He added that as inflation began to ease, it appeared that history was repeating itself. However, following the significant rate cut on September 18th, something unusual occurred: long-term rates rose for the first time since 1995. This shift, which he described as a “total buzzkill,” is beginning to manifest in corporate earnings reports. He went on to say: “If the bond market doesn’t start behaving, or at least calming down, if longer-term interest rates don’t stop going up, we’re going to start losing the groups that have led us higher for months now.” In conclusion, Cramer warned: “If it [the bond market] doesn't stop its retreat, then we're gonna start questioning the idea that the Fed will keep cutting rates, ushering in a fabulous economy for 2025, which is what I was looking for.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on October 29. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Talking about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Cramer said: “AMD reported a strong set of results this evening, partially fueled by demand for their AI chips, the only ones that come close to Nvidia’s. However, they also gave you some not-so-hot guidance for the current quarter because they're worried about supply constraints. The demand for these chips is off the charts, but they may not be able to make enough of them because there's only so much high-end semiconductor capacity worldwide. Now to me, silly little me, that seemed like a high-quality problem. But it's a problem nonetheless, which is why the stock got slammed in the after-hours trading.” Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a prominent company within the semiconductor sector, particularly gaining favor among personal computer manufacturers. On October 29, the company released its third-quarter financial results, which met market expectations for earnings while exceeding sales projections. In this quarter, it reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.92, accompanied by revenues of $6.82 billion. This revenue surpassed Wall Street's average forecast of $6.71 billion, indicating a stronger-than-anticipated sales performance during this period. However, despite these positive figures, management's forward guidance raised concerns among investors, reflecting a cautious outlook. During Advanced Micro Devices’ (NASDAQ:AMD) earnings call, CEO Lisa Su addressed the current supply chain situation, stating that while the environment remains challenging, the company has effectively managed its capacity throughout the supply chain. Su emphasized that while the company expects continued tightness in supply in the coming quarters, there are plans for significant growth leading into 2025.

Kovach observes that, apart from ChatGPT, no other AI product has achieved a breakthrough, despite ongoing efforts from many companies. Currently, most of the money is going to chip makers and cloud businesses, and there is no evidence of meaningful sales or engagement around AI products that people may want to use every day. Kovach's observation implies that tech giants continue to invest heavily in foundational AI advancements and that high-engagement consumer products may still have time to launch. Additionally, many of these big tech companies have reported that they will continue to step up their already high spending on AI infrastructure.

(NASDAQ:AMD) is an American multinational corporation known for designing and developing computer processors and graphics technologies. By incorporating technology across CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, it strives to create a strong ecosystem that supports the development of powerful AI applications. On October 30, AMD Staff published a whitepaper claiming that its Ryzen AI 9 HX 375 processor can outshine Intel Core Ultra 7 258v processor in throughput and latency for AI workloads. The company claims that Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 375 processor achieves up to 27% faster performance than its competition when looking at tokens per second, which is a key metric for LLM performance. Another benchmark proving AMD’s processor superiority is its “time to first token”. The time to first token measures the latency between the moment you submit a prompt and the time it takes for the model to start generating tokens. As per the company, the AMD Ryzen™ AI HX 375 processor is up to 3.5x faster than a comparable competitor in larger language models. Overall AMD ranks 5th on our list of the AI stocks investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) reported its third quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating expectations on revenue but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. Positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher, with the chipmaker's stock up over 8% Friday. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. For the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects revenue of between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $13.6 billion. The company also said it has two new customers for its 18A processor. Revenue for the company's data center and AI business came in at $3.35 billion; analysts were looking for $3.1 billion. Intel's Client Computing segment, which deals with the sale of chips for laptops and desktops, brought in revenue of $7.3 billion, versus expectations of $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in revenue during the same quarter last year. Intel’s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, saw revenue of $4.35 billion. Wall Street was looking for $4.4 billion. The division saw revenue of $4.7 billion in Q3 2023. Intel is dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash. Intel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success. Intel’s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel’s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short. Intel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that’s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there’s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they fell slightly in Q3, according to Gartner. The company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel’s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years. It’s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company’s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before. Qualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance. Intel’s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company’s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Another kitchen sink type of earnings day from chip giant Intel (INTC). Intel stock (INTC) rose slightly in premarket trading on Friday as the struggling US icon managed to serve up better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Shares had been up about 8% late Thursday, but a cautious earnings call subdued sentiment. ""This was a critical quarter for us, and I think [it] gives optimism for what is to come,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance moments after the company's earnings call ended (video above). The somewhat positive market reaction may be a tad overdone when digging into the quarterly results. Intel revealed $15.9 billion in total non-cash charges related to inventory write-downs and lower performance expectations for certain businesses, such as autonomous driving firm Mobileye (MBLY), where it owns a majority stake. The company reported a $5.8 billion operating loss at Intel Foundry — Intel's upstart chipmaking business — on $4.4 billion in sales. Intel took a cautious stance on the health of the foundry business and its artificial intelligence product roadmap in 2025. ""The bad news, in our view, is that Intel's AI strategy appears to have changed again, now with what seems to be a longer-term approach that centers on the traditional CPU+co-processor/accelerator approach to Enterprise class AI workloads,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note on Friday. On the earnings call, management promised to continue executing a $10 billion cost-cutting plan and exploring alternative sources of funding to support chipmaking ambitions. Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance that no deal is imminent in terms of external funding. He reiterated that Intel will push forward with opening chipmaking plants in states like Ohio and Arizona despite not receiving billions of dollars in funding yet from the CHIPS Act. The Biden administration has earmarked $8.5 billion in direct funding to Intel for its projects, but the company is still awaiting the cash as government officials iron out milestones that it must hit. ""Overall, we are seeing the CHIPS Act as a critical thing that we've invested a lot of time and energy into, and as we said on our earnings call, we're disappointed by the time that it's taken to get done,"" Gelsinger said. ""It's well over two years since the CHIPS Act passed. And over that period, I've invested $30 billion in US manufacturing and we've seen $0 from the CHIPS Act. This has taken too long. We need to get it finished."" To be sure, Wall Street still sees a bumpy road ahead for Intel. Intel faces an ""uphill battle"" to turn itself around and compete with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan's TSMC (TSM), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently told Yahoo Finance. He added the company will need some time to get its technology — notably AI chips — on par with its rivals, if they can do it at all. And BofA analyst Vivek Arya struck a cautious tone on Intel in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast (listen here). Gelsinger also clarified the company's relationship with TSMC to Yahoo Finance. Reuters reported that Gelsinger made comments early on in his Intel tenure that strained the relationship with the semiconductor manufacturing giant. In turn, TSMC pulled a discount it was giving Intel on 3-nanometer wafers. ""They are an awesome company. They have just created the foundry model. They service customers extremely well, and they service us well. And, Lunar Lake, the AI PC that we spoke about, we couldn't do it without TSMC — they've been critical to that project's success,"" Gelsinger said. ""That said, we want to be a Western foundry at scale, and we think that's seminally important for the Western world. ... And finally, I supply them with some of our advanced equipment as well. So it's a complex relationship but critically important for Intel, for TSMC, for the industry,"" added Gelsinger, who called TSMC a customer and a competitor that they have a great partnership with.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell nearly 5% Thursday on investor fears of a slowdown in artificial intelligence spending and potential delivery delays of its AI chips. Semiconductor stocks suffered across the board. The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%. Microsoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from “third parties” weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software. “Microsoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can’t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,” wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Persistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen. “As long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow … the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,” she said. “The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.” Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. “As we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,” said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company’s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be “likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.” Advanced Micro Devices’ quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company’s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday. To be sure, Big Tech companies’ AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google’s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday. Meta said it expects ""significant capital expenditure growth in 2025."" Nvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20.

Intel is also dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash.

Revenue for the company’s Client Computing segment, which deals with sales of chips for laptops and desktops, is expected to decline 5% to $7.4 billion versus $7.8 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenue for Intel’s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, is also expected to drop some 6% to $4.4 billion versus $4.7 billion in Q3 2023. The company is, however, expected to report growth in its data center and AI segment, with revenue set to climb to $3.1 billion from $3 billion last year.

But there’s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they dipped slightly in Q3, according to Gartner. The company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel’s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years. It’s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company’s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before. Qualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance. Intel’s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company’s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
 SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct.  31, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Today, AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) unveiled new desktop computing products, delivering enhanced performance for gamers. The lineup features the new AMD Ryzen™ 7 9800X3D Desktop processor, based on the ""Zen 5"" architecture and utilizing 2nd Gen AMD 3D V-Cache™ technology. With the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor, AMD has re-engineered its cutting-edge on-chip memory solution with 2nd Gen AMD 3D V-Cache technology. The 64MB cache memory has been relocated below the processor, which puts the core complex die (CCD) closer to the cooling solution to help keep the “Zen 5” cores cooler, delivering high clock rates and providing up to an average 8% gaming performance improvement compared to our last-gen generation1 and up to an average 20% faster than the competition2. This revolutionary change in placement allows for extreme overclocking of the processor3.

news,2024-10-30 20:35:00,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): Institutional Investors Are Shorting This Semiconductor Stock Now",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-003557055.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jefferies' Top Crowded Semiconductor Short Positions: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other semiconductor stocks. With the third quarter earnings season with us, the semiconductor industry continues to be filled with surprises. 2023 and the better part of 2024 have seen investors remain bullish about chips due to the increased market size resulting from artificial intelligence. Yet--at the same time--the pipers of Wall Street have also been wary of over-investing in artificial intelligence and the state of the broader chip manufacturing industry apart from the fortunes of the AI industry. For the latter front, October has been quite eventful. It once again reminded us that even the firms closest to a monopoly these days aren't immune from either macroeconomic headwinds or from worried investors. It saw the shares of the most important company in the semiconductor industry tank by a stunning 21.64% in just two days after a rather interesting set of events. This stock ranked 8th on our recent list of AI stocks that were trending in the news and this was unsurprising. It was due to report its earnings on October 16th, but the report ended up leaking a day earlier. Earnings leaks are a serious matter, and even more so for this firm since its business provides investors with early insight into the affairs of the semiconductor industry ahead of an earnings cycle for other firms. The leaked earnings saw the firm guide its 2025 net sales at a midpoint of €32.5 billion as it warned that the weakness in the semiconductor industry ""is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness."" Since its machines are booked months in advance, the firm has a greater insight into its future cash flows than others, and investors were further spooked by its bookings. The bookings sat at €2.6 billion as of the third quarter, for a wide miss over midpoint analyst estimates of €5 billion. Consequently, investors weren't impressed. The day that the earnings report leaked, the shares dropped by 16% for their biggest one-day drop in more than two decades. They continued their downward spiral the following day to close 6.42% lower and extend the two-day cumulative drop to 21.64%. While these drops might seem to be a bit too much since after all, you don't see multi-decade records get broken every day, they stem from the uncertainty that investors have to contend with when analyzing complex industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry is divided into three tiers. Starting from the top, firms like GPU and CPU designers are responsible for selling products to consumers and businesses. The second tier is made of manufacturers which produce the chips and the third is made of firms that provide the manufacturing equipment. Consequently, the fact that the chip manufacturing equipment provider's downbeat revenue guidance wiped off billions of dollars of capital from the semiconductor industry was unsurprising. As per Bloomberg, following the bookings miss and lower guidance, US-listed chip stocks, and Asian stocks bled a collective $420 billion in value. Michael Roeg, an analyst at investment bank Petercam Degroof provided more color into the drop. After the release, he shared that sales trends at the world's largest contract chip manufacturer ""are a misleading indicator for the overall health of the semiconductor industry."" This is because the firm ""has been spending rather low capex numbers so far this year, and they may do so again next year because their overall (plant) utilization is not as good as their sales numbers suggest."" Utilization refers to the percentage of time that expensive chip machines are running and producing chips and fabs prefer to have high rates since it decreases the time it takes for them to recuperate their investment. Low capital expenditure affects utilization since if utilization is low then chip manufacturers do not feel the need to spend heavily for new machines. In sum, these trends mean that semiconductor spending at the bottom tier of the industry remains muted unless demand picks up and utilization grows. Shifting gears, the top tier of the industry is divided into several categories. One category includes firms like Wall Street's favorite AI stock, the GPU designer whose shares are up 198% year-to-date. Due to the market's rush into AI, while investors have been kind to this firm, they have been far more prudent for others. One such firm is responsible for manufacturing silicon carbide chips that are used for power management by electric vehicles. Since the demand for EV vehicles has slowed, leading to the shares of Elon Musk's car company losing 12.3% year to date, the shares of this firm haven't done well either. They are down 18.3% year to date, and if you're interested in knowing more about this stock, we've included it in today's list. This overall bifurcation in the semiconductor industry hasn't skipped the attention of institutional investors. According to Jefferies' October Trading Positioning Survey, the percentage of investors overweight on semiconductor stocks was 42%, a strong 18-point drop over July's figures. The funds that were underweight on these stocks grew by five points from July to sit at 16%, so let's take a look at the stocks that they have shorted. Our Methodology To make our list of Jefferies' top overcrowded semiconductor short positions, we ranked the top ten crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 108 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 2.76% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor design company. The firm designs and sells CPUs and GPUs for a variety of use cases. These include personal computers, gaming consoles, data centers, and AI use cases. This makes Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) the only firm in the world that simultaneously competes with both NVIDIA and Intel. The firm has benefited from Intel's struggles and leverages product design along with TSMC's manufacturing technologies to gain market share over the larger firm. Additionally, in a price-constrained environment, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) benefits because of its affordability, and its smaller size also easily captures market share. The firm has been making aggressive investments in AI recently through multiple acquisitions that are aimed at bolstering its position in the data center industry. However, these acquisitions come at a cost and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has been debt-stressed until very recently so future leverage might create a headwind. Baron Funds mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: ""Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high performance computing technology, software, and products including CPUs, 9 GPUs, FPGAs, 10 and others. Shares of AMD remain volatile, and after a strong run earlier in the year, the stock fell during the quarter as investors continue to wrestle with AMD’s competitive positioning in the AI compute market relative to NVIDIA, who continues to strengthen its full-system solution offerings at a rapid pace. AMD also updated its MI300 GPU chip revenue expectations for the full year to “greater than $4 billion” vs. prior $3.5 billion, which disappointed the market a bit relative to high expectations. Over the long-term, we believe AMD, with its unique chiplet-based architecture and open-source software ecosystem, will play a meaningful role in the rapidly growing AI compute market, where customers don’t want to be locked into a single vendor and AMD offers a compelling total-cost-of-ownership proposition, especially in inferencing workloads. Simultaneously, we believe AMD will continue to take share from Intel within traditional data center CPUs, which, while now a slower growth market, is likely to see a near-term refresh as data centers look for ways to improve energy efficiency and optimize existing footprints."" Overall AMD ranks 5th on Jefferies' list of the top semiconductor stocks institutional investors are shorting. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. slid 11% Wednesday after the chipmaker’s revenue outlook fell short of Wall Street’s expectations, signaling that its artificial intelligence sales are growing slower than some had anticipated. Most Read from Bloomberg Is Denver’s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off? NY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow There Will Soon Be No Meatpackers Left in NYC’s Historic Meatpacking District A South Korean City Plays Matchmaker to Tackle a Fertility Crisis Revenue will be roughly $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter, the company said Tuesday. Analysts estimated $7.55 billion on average. Though the company now expects to get more than $5 billion in sales from so-called AI accelerators this year — up from a previous forecast of $4.5 billion — some investors had been looking for a bigger bump. AMD is playing catch-up with Nvidia Corp. in the lucrative market for these chips, which help develop and run AI services. AMD is now generating billions of dollars from that type of product — a rapid rise from a year ago — but the level remains well short of the tens of billions of dollars that its rival is raking in. On a conference call following the results, Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su pushed back on concerns that AMD isn’t delivering enough growth. The company is ramping up production and earning the trust of the large data center companies that rely on AI accelerators, she said. “What I will say is customers are very, very open to AMD,” Su said. “And we see that everywhere we go. Everyone is giving us a very fair shot at earning their business, and that’s what we intend to do.” AMD shares fell to $148.60 in New York on Wednesday, the worst single-day decline since October 2022. They had been up 13% this year before the rout. AMD’s third-quarter revenue rose 18% to $6.82 billion, beating an average estimate of $6.71 billion. Profit, minus certain items, increased to 92 cents a share, in line with projections. AMD’s new MI300 accelerator products, which compete with Nvidia chips, have emerged as one of its biggest sales engines. But the growth has been hampered by the availability of supply. Like most companies in the industry, AMD no longer owns its own plants, opting instead to outsource production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company has made progress in getting more supply from its vendors, but still expects to have little latitude in terms of meeting demand if it’s above current projections, Su said on the call. “I think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we’ve also planned for significant growth going into 2025,” Su said. “We feel good about our overall supply-chain capability.” Investors track AMD’s performance as an indicator of overall demand for AI-related hardware. Massive spending by companies such as Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Microsoft Corp. on this still-new type of computing infrastructure has upended the industry. The concern among investors is that AI services aren’t yet big moneymakers, which may make it harder for companies to continue justifying the expense of buying the chips. In addition to being Nvidia’s biggest rival in AI accelerators, AMD also competes with that company in graphics chips used by computer gamers. And it goes head-to-head with Intel Corp. in personal computer and server processors. AMD’s data-center unit had sales of $3.5 billion last quarter, more than double the total from a year earlier and slightly above estimates. PC chips brought in $1.88 billion, up 29%. AMD also supplies custom processors for Microsoft and Sony Group Corp. for their game consoles. That unit has seen weaker sales, hurt by the current generation of game machines nearing the end of their life cycles. Revenue fell 69% to $462 million, missing estimates. AMD also predicted a fourth-quarter adjusted gross margin — the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production — that was just shy of projections.

Google's parent company said it expects its capital spending to increase substantially in 2025. That's good news for chip makers. The semiconductor giant is achieving record revenue thanks to AI. China is home to US e-commerce giant Amazon.com's four biggest merchant bases, according to new research, showing the significant role that the world's second-largest economy continues to play in the global supply chain despite geopolitical tensions. Shenzhen, a technology and factory hub in China's southern Guangdong province, leads the pack with 102,588 sellers registered on Amazon, collectively generating US$35.3 billion revenue annually, according to US e-commerce service provider Smartscout Alphabet's third-quarter 2024 results benefit from strength in Search, advertising revenues and Google Cloud. Google parent Alphabet posted third-quarter earnings that topped Street expectations and showed artificial intelligence (AI) progress, with both JPMorgan and Citigroup analysts noting the tech giant's strong Google Cloud revenue. Jazz (JAZZ) doesn't possess the right combination of the two key ingredients for a likely earnings beat in its upcoming report. Get prepared with the key expectations. The chipmaker's data center revenue soared 122% year over year, driven by continued powerful demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips that compete with larger rival Nvidia's chips. Google reported a 15% jump in year-over-year revenue driven by strong results in its cloud-computing division, boosting the company’s fortunes during a costly push into artificial intelligence. Boeing’s $5 billion mandatory convertible preferred deal with a 6% dividend yield has surged about 10%. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will report third-quarter financial results tomorrow, October 31, after the closing bell. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann anticipates that the tech giant will report results that are in line with expectations as the PC market stabilizes. However, he notes that this will be tempered by challenging trends in the data center sector, mainly due to market share losses to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD).

news,2024-10-30 14:50:00,"Short Sellers Are Targeting Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/short-sellers-targeting-advanced-micro-185042035.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jefferies’ Top Crowded Semiconductor Short Positions: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. With the third quarter earnings season with us, the semiconductor industry continues to be filled with surprises. 2023 and the better part of 2024 have seen investors remain bullish about chips due to the increased market size resulting from artificial intelligence. Yet–at the same time–the pipers of Wall Street have also been wary of over-investing in artificial intelligence and the state of the broader chip manufacturing industry apart from the fortunes of the AI industry. For the latter front, October has been quite eventful. It once again reminded us that even the firms closest to a monopoly these days aren’t immune from either macroeconomic headwinds or from worried investors. It saw the shares of the most important company in the semiconductor industry tank by a stunning 21.64% in just two days after a rather interesting set of events. This stock ranked 8th on our recent list of AI stocks that were trending in the news and this was unsurprising. It was due to report its earnings on October 16th, but the report ended up leaking a day earlier. Earnings leaks are a serious matter, and even more so for this firm since its business provides investors with early insight into the affairs of the semiconductor industry ahead of an earnings cycle for other firms. The leaked earnings saw the firm guide its 2025 net sales at a midpoint of €32.5 billion as it warned that the weakness in the semiconductor industry “is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness.” Since its machines are booked months in advance, the firm has a greater insight into its future cash flows than others, and investors were further spooked by its bookings. The bookings sat at €2.6 billion as of the third quarter, for a wide miss over midpoint analyst estimates of €5 billion. Consequently, investors weren’t impressed. The day that the earnings report leaked, the shares dropped by 16% for their biggest one-day drop in more than two decades. They continued their downward spiral the following day to close 6.42% lower and extend the two-day cumulative drop to 21.64%. While these drops might seem to be a bit too much since after all, you don’t see multi-decade records get broken every day, they stem from the uncertainty that investors have to contend with when analyzing complex industries such as semiconductor fabrication. Broadly speaking, the semiconductor industry is divided into three tiers. Starting from the top, firms like GPU and CPU designers are responsible for selling products to consumers and businesses. The second tier is made of manufacturers which produce the chips and the third is made of firms that provide the manufacturing equipment. Consequently, the fact that the chip manufacturing equipment provider’s downbeat revenue guidance wiped off billions of dollars of capital from the semiconductor industry was unsurprising. As per Bloomberg, following the bookings miss and lower guidance, US-listed chip stocks, and Asian stocks bled a collective $420 billion in value. Michael Roeg, an analyst at investment bank Petercam Degroof provided more color into the drop. After the release, he shared that sales trends at the world’s largest contract chip manufacturer “are a misleading indicator for the overall health of the semiconductor industry.” This is because the firm “has been spending rather low capex numbers so far this year, and they may do so again next year because their overall (plant) utilization is not as good as their sales numbers suggest.” Utilization refers to the percentage of time that expensive chip machines are running and producing chips and fabs prefer to have high rates since it decreases the time it takes for them to recuperate their investment. Low capital expenditure affects utilization since if utilization is low then chip manufacturers do not feel the need to spend heavily for new machines. In sum, these trends mean that semiconductor spending at the bottom tier of the industry remains muted unless demand picks up and utilization grows. Shifting gears, the top tier of the industry is divided into several categories. One category includes firms like Wall Street’s favorite AI stock, the GPU designer whose shares are up 198% year-to-date. Due to the market’s rush into AI, while investors have been kind to this firm, they have been far more prudent for others. One such firm is responsible for manufacturing silicon carbide chips that are used for power management by electric vehicles. Since the demand for EV vehicles has slowed, leading to the shares of Elon Musk’s car company losing 12.3% year to date, the shares of this firm haven’t done well either. They are down 18.3% year to date, and if you’re interested in knowing more about this stock, we’ve included it in today’s list. This overall bifurcation in the semiconductor industry hasn’t skipped the attention of institutional investors. According to Jefferies’ October Trading Positioning Survey, the percentage of investors overweight on semiconductor stocks was 42%, a strong 18-point drop over July’s figures. The funds that were underweight on these stocks grew by five points from July to sit at 16%, so let’s take a look at the stocks that they have shorted. Our Methodology To make our list of Jefferies’ top overcrowded semiconductor short positions, we ranked the top ten crowded short positions from the latest Trading Positioning Survey by their shares short as a percentage of outstanding shares. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 108 Shares Short % Of Outstanding: 2.76% Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor design company. The firm designs and sells CPUs and GPUs for a variety of use cases. These include personal computers, gaming consoles, data centers, and AI use cases. This makes Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) the only firm in the world that simultaneously competes with both NVIDIA and Intel. The firm has benefited from Intel’s struggles and leverages product design along with TSMC’s manufacturing technologies to gain market share over the larger firm. Additionally, in a price-constrained environment, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) benefits because of its affordability, and its smaller size also easily captures market share. The firm has been making aggressive investments in AI recently through multiple acquisitions that are aimed at bolstering its position in the data center industry. However, these acquisitions come at a cost and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has been debt-stressed until very recently so future leverage might create a headwind. Baron Funds mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a global fabless semiconductor company focusing on high performance computing technology, software, and products including CPUs, 9 GPUs, FPGAs, 10 and others. Shares of AMD remain volatile, and after a strong run earlier in the year, the stock fell during the quarter as investors continue to wrestle with AMD’s competitive positioning in the AI compute market relative to NVIDIA, who continues to strengthen its full-system solution offerings at a rapid pace. AMD also updated its MI300 GPU chip revenue expectations for the full year to “greater than $4 billion” vs. prior $3.5 billion, which disappointed the market a bit relative to high expectations. Over the long-term, we believe AMD, with its unique chiplet-based architecture and open-source software ecosystem, will play a meaningful role in the rapidly growing AI compute market, where customers don’t want to be locked into a single vendor and AMD offers a compelling total-cost-of-ownership proposition, especially in inferencing workloads. Simultaneously, we believe AMD will continue to take share from Intel within traditional data center CPUs, which, while now a slower growth market, is likely to see a near-term refresh as data centers look for ways to improve energy efficiency and optimize existing footprints.” Overall, AMD ranks 5th on our list of Jefferies’ top crowded semiconductor short positions' stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) fell 9.6% in the morning session after the company reported weak third-quarter earnings results. Its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts' expectations. Revenue beat analysts' expectations by a narrow margin during the quarter, while EBITDA beat more convincingly. The outlook is weighing on shares as expectations were likely high heading into the announcement amid the ongoing AI rave. The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy AMD? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. AMD’s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 20 days ago when the stock dropped 5.1% on the news that the company announced new data center AI chips (AMD Instinct MI325X Accelerators), barely a day after executives of rival Nvidia announced to Wall Street analysts that the Blackwell GPU (designed for AI workloads) products are ""booked out 12 months."" Also, AMD's new AI chip won't begin shipping until the first quarter of 2025. AMD's CEO Lisa Su touts her company’s new platform as superior to Nvidia's Blackwell when specific inference benchmarks are used. AMD is up 7.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $149.47 per share, it is still trading 29.3% below its 52-week high of $211.38 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $4,512. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) will report third-quarter financial results tomorrow, October 31, after the closing bell. Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann anticipates that the tech giant will report results that are in line with expectations as the PC market stabilizes. However, he notes that this will be tempered by challenging trends in the data center sector, mainly due to market share losses to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Related Read: AMD Q3 Earnings: Revenue Beat, EPS In Line, Data Center Up 122%, ‘Significant’ Growth Opportunities Ahead Driven By ‘Insatiable’ Demand According to the analyst, Intel is moving towards a more agile structure following a 15% reduction in its workforce and a suspension of its dividend, aiming to prepare for a projected slowdown in 2025. Consequently, the analyst lacks confidence in the out quarter estimates, as Intel struggles to catch up with the current AI cycle while working to improve its CPU roadmap and the Intel Foundry business, among other challenges. The analyst indicated that for the September quarter, revenue is estimated at $13 billion, aligning with the consensus, which reflects an 8% year-over-year decline and a 1% quarter-over-quarter increase. Management’s guidance for the quarter ranges from $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, Mosesmann noted. The analyst projects December quarter revenue will be $14 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $13.7 billion. This estimate represents a 9.1% year-over-year decline and a 7.7% quarter-over-quarter increase. Also Read: What’s Going On With Polestar Automotive Stock Today?

news,2024-10-30 13:16:00,Yahoo Finance Week in Tech: Its all about earnings and Apple,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yahoo-finance-week-in-tech-its-all-about-earnings-and-apple-171624349.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. It’s Wednesday, and that means it’s time for Yahoo Finance’s Week in Tech. I’m Dan Howley, and this week is all about earnings. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Intel (INTC) are each updating investors on their financial performance over the past few months, and AI is top of mind across the board. Alphabet and AMD reported their results Tuesday, and while both performed well — Alphabet beat Wall Street’s expectations on the top and bottom lines, and AMD met expectations on revenue and beat on earnings per share — shares of the companies are heading in opposite directions, with Alphabet shares headed higher and AMD shares sliding. Beyond the earnings rush, there was one other big story this week: Apple’s cavalcade of product announcements. The company not only released its initial batch of Apple Intelligence features through software updates for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, it also unveiled a line of new Mac laptops and desktops, as well as two new high-powered chips. It’s been a heck of a week so far, and we’ve still got two days to go. Big Tech’s earnings season feels like it’s been compressed into a single week, which is both a blessing and a curse for yours truly. Sure, it gets all of the work out of the way in one shot, but it also means my keyboard is getting a heck of a workout. Google parent Alphabet and AMD both provided solid results on Tuesday, but investors weren’t happy with AMD’s guidance for the current quarter, sending shares sliding more than 9% in early trading Wednesday. Alphabet shares, meanwhile, climbed more than 6% on the strength of its AI and cloud business growth. AMD said that it expects to see Q4 revenue of between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, which was just shy of expectations of $7.55 billion. That’s not exactly the kind of beat and raise Wall Street has come to expect from AI chip names. Still, even at the low end of guidance, AMD’s Q4 revenue would jump $1 billion versus the $6.2 billion it brought in during the same period last year. Despite disappointment among traders, CEO Lisa Su said there’s an “insatiable demand for more computers” among customers. Alphabet, on the other hand, is on a roll, thanks to growth in its advertising and cloud services revenue. Ad sales beat expectations, jumping from $59.6 billion a year ago to $65.8 billion in its most recent quarter, while cloud revenue increased a whopping 35%. Both businesses benefit from Google’s AI investments, with AI for Alphabet’s cloud platform helping to draw enterprise customers and improving advertising services. But Alphabet has plenty of competition, including Microsoft, which reports after the bell on Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. There’s still plenty of earnings news ahead, so stay tuned. Apple is also having a heck of a week, with updates to its iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro lines of desktops and laptops; the debut of two new chips (the M4 Pro and M4 Max); and the rollout of its Apple Intelligence platform. The new iMac gets upgraded performance via the company’s M4 chip, which first debuted alongside the new iPad Pro back in May. Apple also outfitted the iMac with a new nanotexture display coating to reduce glare and the company’s Center Stage camera that keeps subjects in frame during video calls. The Mac mini, meanwhile, gets a full redesign that shrinks its footprint to 5 inches by 5 inches. Despite its smaller size, the pint-sized mini is also more powerful than its predecessor, thanks to the inclusion of Apple’s M4 chip, as well as the option to upgrade to the new M4 Pro for even greater performance gains. Then there’s the MacBook Pro, which is available with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. Apple says the Pro can also be equipped with a nanotexture display like the iMac and that it now gets up to 24 hours of battery life. All of the systems are also built with Apple Intelligence in mind. Available via iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS 15.1, Apple Intelligence is the company’s first major step into the generative AI space. But the company is releasing the software in stages throughout the end of this year and across 2025. The first set of capabilities won’t exactly blow consumers’ minds, either. The platform’s flashiest feature is its notification summaries for texts, news updates, and other messages. But Apple plans to add ChatGPT integration to Siri and release its Apple Intelligence update in the coming months, which should prove far more exciting.

news,2024-10-30 11:11:00,"Do Fund Managers Love Or Hate Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD)?",Insider Monkey,https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/do-fund-managers-love-or-hate-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-1382242/,"Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive investment research and ad free browsing! Our #1 AI Stock Pick is on a steep discount - 29$ instead of 99$! Click here to access exclusive research! We recently compiled a list of the BofA’s List Of AI & Semiconductor Stocks That Fund Managers Love & Hate: 16 Stocks On The Manager Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA’s list that fund managers love and hate. The initial wave of artificial intelligence investing has shaken up the stock market. Suddenly, technology stocks are divided between those that have exposure to AI and those that don’t. The former category has soared to set records while the latter has been lackluster because of the state of sluggishness in the non-AI business world. Within AI stocks that have outdone themselves, semiconductor stocks are a standout. Additionally, just as is the case with broader technology stocks, semiconductor stocks are also divided between those with AI and non-AI exposure. The best example of the former category is Wall Street’s top AI stock pick. This stock is of a firm that designs and sells GPUs used to process AI workloads. Its shares are up 845% since the 2023 start and have set multiple records since OpenAI’s Chat GPT became publicly available. On the flip side, another semiconductor stock has floundered during the same period even though it’s one of the oldest and largest semiconductor companies in the world. This stock belongs to a firm that is also one of the only three companies in the world that can manufacture high-end semiconductors and it is the only one which is headquartered in the US. While the GPU designer’s shares have gained 845%, over the same time, this semiconductor stock is down 13.9%, and year to date the shares have bled an unbelievable 53.14%. Therein lies the bifurcation between semiconductor stocks that is fueled by the artificial intelligence wave. However, these returns might belong to the first stage of AI stocks only, implying that other semiconductor companies could also see gains provided robust AI software demand and the ability of firms to monetize their products.  We covered a lot of such potential stocks as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. In this list, there were five semiconductor stocks. Four of these are semiconductor manufacturers while the remaining stock is the firm whose designs are the backbone of the modern-day smartphone industry. The stocks are ranked 19th, 16th, 14th, 8th, and 6th. Looking at their year-to-date performance, these stocks are up roughly 45%, 51.7%, 65.7%, 97.8%, and 122% year-to-date, respectively. Safe to say, the AI wave has been kind to these stocks. The next step in our brief analysis is to see what analysts believe the future holds for these firms. To do this, one particularly useful ratio is the forward price to earnings since it gauges the current price to analyst estimates of future earnings. For these five phase two AI semiconductor stocks, the forward P/E ratios in respective orders are roughly 31.25, 50.51, 29.41, 25.19, and 99 times. The forward P/E ratio for global and US semiconductor stocks is 45.77 so most of these stocks are fairly valued. Consequently, this implies that in case of an AI correction that sees investor sentiment evaporate for any reason, these stocks might not be hit as hard as those speculating about an ‘AI bubble’ might worry, but if Wall Street finds more reasons to add to its AI euphoria, then their valuation might further bloom for more gains. Shifting gears, the average forward P/E ratio for the semiconductor industry also leads us to wonder which stocks are driving this average value higher. After all, the six AI chip stocks we’ve covered above include some of the biggest companies in the world. However, high P/E ratios commonly belong to smaller companies that earn small profits but have a much higher share price. Two stocks that we’ve identified that have at least 2x the average forward P/E ratio are both unprofitable right now. The one with the higher forward P/E ratio of 196.08 ranks 20th on our list of Piper Sandler’s Top Technical Stock Picks: 20 Best Stocks while the second with a beefy ratio of 133.33 ranked 32nd on this list of AI stocks that were recently trending. So, the next question to ask is, what makes these stocks so special that despite the fact that neither is currently profitable, investors have valued their shares more than 100 times over their projected earnings? Well, starting from the first stock with the higher P/E ratio, this firm is one of the few hardened integrated circuit manufacturers in the US. It makes radiation-resistant chips for the US military and its tools enable chip designs at various nodes. The second stock, which is up 49% year to date, is a specialty chip manufacturer that makes and sells silicon-based timing devices as an alternative to quartz-based products. These are used in applications such as edge computing and 5G networks – systems that are closer to end users and therefore must endure more strenuous working environments. Our Methodology  To make our list of semiconductor stocks that fund managers love and hate according to BofA, we used its recent list of semiconductor stocks that were popular or losing popularity with fund managers. The list was divided into two sections based on expansion or decline in ownership.  Stocks within each category were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q2 2024.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q2 2024: 108 Section: Losing Popularity  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is the second biggest firm in the x86 CPU market which makes it quite important as this industry is effectively a duopoly. It competes with Intel in the CPU market and NVIDIA in the GPU market, making Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) the only firm capable of targeting both of the biggest chip companies in the industry. Additionally, acquisitions such as that of an FPGA company mean that Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a rare company capable of competing at all ends of the AI ecosystem, from CPUs to GPUs, and customizable chips. However, it is a distant second to NVIDIA in the GPU market and also depends on non-AI enterprise data center spending for a large portion of its revenue. Yet, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) could see tailwinds as AI use accelerates in the business world and firms seek low-cost accelerators amidst supply constraints for NVIDIA products. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s management commented on its data center business during the Q2 2024 earnings call. Here is what they shared: “Turning to the segments, data center segment revenue increased 115% year-over-year to a record $2.8 billion, driven by the steep ramp of Instinct MI300 GPU shipments and a strong double-digit percentage increase in EPYC CPU sales. Cloud adoption remains strong as hyperscalers deploy fourth-gen EPYC CPUs to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. We are seeing hyperscalers select EPYC processors to power a larger portion of their applications and workloads, displacing incumbent offerings across their infrastructure with AMD solutions that offer clear performance and efficiency advantages. The number of AMD-powered cloud instances available from the largest providers has increased 34% from a year ago to more than 900. We are seeing strong pull for these instances with both enterprise and cloud-first businesses. As an example, Netflix and Uber both recently selected fourth-gen EPYC Public Cloud instances as one of the key solutions to power their mission critical customer facing workloads. In the enterprise, sales were increased by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple large wins in the quarter with financial services, technology, health care, retail, manufacturing, and transportation customers, including Adobe, Boeing, Industrial Light & Magic, Optiver, and Siemens. Importantly, more than one-third of our enterprise server wins in the first half of the year were with businesses deploying EPYC in their data centers for the first time, highlighting our success attracting new customers, while also continuing to expand our footprint with existing customers.” Overall AMD ranks 11th on our list of the AI and semiconductor stocks in BofA’s list that fund managers love and hate. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investing.com -- Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) unveiled guidance for current-quarter revenue and artificial intelligence chip sales that disappointed investors, sending shares down by more than 8% in premarket US trading on Wednesday. Due to soaring AI chip demand from a host of large tech firms like software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), AMD has been struggling to provide the necessary supply of processors. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Lisa Su flagged that supplies of AI chips would be restrained heading into the upcoming year. ""[G]oing into the next few quarters going into 2025, I think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we've also planned for significant growth going into 2025,"" Su said. For the fourth quarter, AMD's revenue guidance of $7.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, was slightly under analysts' consensus forecasts of $7.55 billion at the midpoint. AMD also increased its projections for sales of its key AI chips for next year to $5 billion from its prior estimate of $4.5 billion, although investors were underwhelmed by the guidance. In a note to clients, analysts at Morgan Stanley said AMD's returns were ""essentially in line"" with consensus forecasts, adding that they were ""somewhat surprised"" by the sell-off in the stock. The chipmaker -- and rival to AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) -- posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 in the third quarter, in line with analyst projections. Group-wide revenue also rose by 22% versus the year-ago period to $6.82 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $6.71 billion. The company's data center segment was a standout performer, with revenue more than doubling to $3.5 billion, while its client business showed strong growth as well. But this strength was partly offset by sales at its gaming unit, which declined 69% to $462 million. ""[W]e still see 2024-25 as investment years for the AI opportunity, and think some revenue [and] earnings expectations are still too high,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore wrote.

Ryan / The Boston Globe via Getty Images  Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) shares are jumping in premarket trading after the tech giant beat earnings estimates on surging cloud revenues; Eli Lilly (LLY) shares are tumbling after its results missed the mark; Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock is sinking after its net income and sales guidance disappointed investors; shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) are dropping after its same-store sales outlook came in below expectations; and Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) shares are rising ahead of their earnings reports after the close. Here's what investors need to know today.
  Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are up 6% in premarket trading after the tech giant reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. Alphabet's revenue climbed 15% year-over-year to $88.27 billion and net income came in at $26.3 billion, or $2.12 per share, beating consensus expectations of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Google Cloud delivered revenue of $11.4 billion, exceeding projections and representing 35% growth from the year-ago period as demand for artificial intelligence (AI) surged.
  Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) are sinking 10% in premarket trading after it reported third-quarter revenue and net income that were well short of analysts' estimates. Lilly reported a profit of $970.3 million, or $1.07 per share, well below the $1.69 billion and $1.87 per share analysts were projecting. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.18 was barely half of the expected $2.18. Weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound continue to boost Eli Lilly's sales, with its revenue of $11.44 billion coming in above last year's $9.50 billion, although below the $12.18 billion consensus.
  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares are falling 8% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported weaker-than-expected net income and guidance for the fourth quarter. While the company's third-quarter revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $6.82 billion, ahead of expectations, its net income of $771 million, or 47 cents per share, was below projections. AMD said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, with the midpoint below analysts' consensus of $7.6 billion.
  Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares are falling 6% in premarket trading after the restaurant chain reported a weaker-than-expected sales forecast. Chipotle said it expects to see 2024 same-store sales increase in the mid- to high-single-digit range, while analysts were anticipating a 7.5% growth rate, according to Visible Alpha. The chain's revenue of $2.79 billion met expectations, while its net income of $387.4 million beat estimates. 
  Shares of Magnificent Seven firms Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) are trading higher in premarket trading ahead of their scheduled earnings releases after markets close today. Microsoft stock is up by 2% ahead of its earnings report, which is expected to show the tech giant deliver a 14% jump in quarterly revenue. Facebook parent Meta, whose shares are also higher by 2%, is expected to register revenue growth of 18%. Earnings from Apple, Amazon, and Intel are scheduled for Thursday.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Corrects paragraph 3 to say $5 billion AI chip sales target is for 2024, not 2025) (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices shares fell 8% on Wednesday after the chip company's revenue forecast failed to impress investors looking for a bigger windfall from the AI boom. AMD could lose around $20 billion in market value, based on premarket movements. The company has been one of the biggest winners of the chip demand boom sparked by the rise of generative AI, with its shares up nearly 156% since end-2022. Its soft quarterly revenue forecast and a $5 billion AI chip sales target for 2024, however, showed that demand for the processors was rising faster than their production, with CEO Lisa Su saying chip supplies will be tight going into next year. ""It is probably unpalatable for an 'AI name' to even guide inline, let alone below,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. ""At this point AI performance, while not bad in the objective sense, appears unlikely to drive upside to current expectations, and talk of 2025 'lumpiness' in the business will probably increase risk (or at least raise some eyebrows)."" Other chip firms such as Arm and Qualcomm also fell more than 2%. But AI chip leader Nvidia was down just 0.3% in a sign that investors did not expect a similar supply shortage impact on the company. Both Nvidia and AMD rely on chip-making giant TSMC to manufacture their advanced AI chips, but analysts have so far shown little concern about Nvidia's AI chip supply. ""AI still dominates this (AMD) story, and while the company did raise (sales expectations) every quarter this year, the concern from here is that AMD won’t be able to provide upside to Street estimates that are already $8 billion-$9 billion for calendar 2025,"" Jefferies analysts said. At least 10 analysts lowered their target price on the AMD stock, while 8 raised their views, moving the median to $187.50, according to LSEG data. That represents an upside of nearly 13% to the company's last closing price. AMD trades at nearly 32 times its 12-month forward earnings estimates, compared with 36 times for Nvidia.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 20 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's latest game plan. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently advised investors to maintain composure as major companies release their earnings this week. Additionally, he highlighted the significance of the upcoming nonfarm payroll report, set to be released on Friday, which he believes will have considerable implications for interest rates. He said that weak hiring figures could prompt the Federal Reserve to continue cutting rates. Last Friday, Cramer noted a mixed performance in the markets: the Dow dropped by 260 points, the S&P fell slightly by 0.03%, while the Nasdaq managed a gain of 0.56%. Cramer characterized the current market conditions as a preparatory phase for an eventful week ahead, urging viewers to pay close attention. READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Tesla and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer is Talking About These 12 Stocks Cramer emphasized the importance of the employment data released on the first Friday of the month, particularly in light of the forthcoming Fed meeting. “Speaking of employment, on the first Friday of the month, we get the nonfarm payroll report. I can't stress how important this number is. We have an upcoming Fed meeting and we're now seeing [that] cyclicals really missed their numbers because of higher interest rates. A lot of them are rolling over. But if employment stays as strong as it's been, then we're going to hear that there will be no November rate cut.” Throughout his commentary, Cramer conveyed a clear message: while it may be tempting to sell, this period aligns with a cycle of Fed rate cuts, suggesting that buying could be the more prudent strategy. He reminded viewers that this week feels charged with significance, likening it to a playoff atmosphere where the stakes are exceptionally high. In his concluding remarks, Cramer said: “Bottom line, huge week, huge opportunity. Just please remember, the first move’s been the wrong move, I'd say probably maybe, almost half the time since this earnings season began. Wait to process the numbers, listen to the conference call before you pull the trigger.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 20 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 25.

(NASDAQ:AMD) and called it a “long-term terrific story”. “Just say you like AMD as we do for the Charitable Trust. We know that AI is big big big. Big enough for more than just one chip maker. AMD won't catch NVIDIA, but it will do enough to take chunks of the business. Plus, it has tremendous PC exposure right into the teeth of a big PC refresh cycle. We're buying more AMD in any weakness for the Trust because this is a long-term terrific story.” Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has established itself as a significant player in the semiconductor industry. The company has gained substantial traction among personal computer manufacturers due to the popularity of its GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), and neural processing units (NPUs). Its Ryzen AI 300 series NPUs are set to power various computing platforms from manufacturers such as Microsoft, Asus, Lenovo, and HP. CEO Lisa Su highlighted in July that a significant increase in the adoption of Instinct MI300 GPUs contributed to this product family surpassing $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. In the second quarter, the company reported $2.8 billion in data center sales, marking an impressive 114% increase compared to the same period last year. On October 10, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) hosted an event titled “Advancing AI,” where Lisa Su revealed details about the next generation of chips. During this event, she also announced plans to introduce the MI350X GPU in the upcoming year, which is set to directly compete with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, with shipments expected to commence in the latter half of 2025. Overall AMD ranks 6th on the list of stocks featured in Jim Cramer's latest game plan.

news,2024-10-29 22:27:00,AMD Stock Price Levels to Watch After Post-Earnings Plunge,Investopedia,https://www.investopedia.com/amd-stock-price-levels-to-watch-after-post-earnings-plunge-8736507," Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares moved sharply lower in extended trading on Tuesday after the chipmaker reported third-quarter earnings that came in below expectations and issued a light current quarter revenue outlook, despite record data center revenue.
  During the company’s conference call, CEO Lisa Su told analysts that the chipmaker now anticipates data center revenue to exceed $5 billion in 2024, up from her July forecast of $4.5 billion, However, the stock’s afterhours decline indicates investors could have been looking for more amid insatiable artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure demand. 
  AMD shares have gained around 13% year to date as of Tuesday’s close, underperforming the tech-heavy Nasdaq index’s return by about half over the same period. The stock fell 7.6% to $153.57 in after-hours trading Tuesday.
  Below, we analyze the technicals on AMD’s weekly chart and point out important post-earnings price levels that other investors may be watching.
  After an inverted hammer marked AMD’s all-time high (ATH) in early March, the stock has traded within a textbook descending channel.
  More recently, the price has rallied into the pattern’s upper trendline, though lower volumes suggest that larger market participants remained on the sidelines ahead of the company's quarterly results.
  Amid the stock’s projected post-earnings sell-off, let’s look at key support levels that may come into play and also forecast a chart-based price target to watch if the shares resume their longer-term uptrend.
  The first important support level to monitor sits around $162. Although the stock sits poised to open below this area on Wednesday, it’s worth watching if bulls make an attempt to defend a trendline linking the prominent November 2021 peak and a range of comparable trading levels within the descending channel.
  A decisive breakdown below this level could see the shares decline to the $132 area, a location where investors may look for buying opportunities around a series of prices situated near the June swing high and August swing low.
  Further selling in the stock opens the door for a fall to around $112, around 33% below Tuesday’s closing price, where the shares find a confluence of support from the 200-week moving average and a horizontal line stretching back to August 2021.
  If AMD shares resume their longer-term uptrend, we can forecast a bullish price target using a bars pattern, a technique that uses historical trends on the chart to predict future price moves.
  In this case, we take the stock’s trend higher from October 2023 to March this year and reposition it from the early August low, which projects a price target of around $275.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.92 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.91 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.70 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.10%.

Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. Advanced Micro , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, posted revenues of $6.82 billion for the quarter ended September 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.59%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.8 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Advanced Micro shares have added about 8.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 22.1%. While Advanced Micro has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

  AMD's revenue gains came as data center sales more than doubled to a fresh high of $3.5 billion, driven by demand for the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips.
  The results come after AMD launched its next generation of AI chips at its Advancing AI event earlier this month, but did not raise its AI sales outlook or announce new customers as many investors had hoped, weighing on its stock price.
  AMD said Tuesday it expects fourth-quarter revenue to land between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion, up from $6.2 billion in the prior-year quarter. The analyst consensus was at the higher end of that range at $7.6 billion, according to Visible Alpha.
  Shares of AMD fell over 7% in extended trading Tuesday following the release.

AMD (AMD) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings on Tuesday, meeting expectations on the earnings per share and beating on revenue. But Wall Street wasn't too keen on the company's Q4 revenue outlook, which it said will come in between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion. Wall Street was looking for $7.55 billion. Shares of the chip maker fell more than 5% immediately following the announcement on fears of slowing AI growth for the company. Despite that, CEO Lisa Su said demand for the company's offerings is strong. ""Looking forward, we see significant growth opportunities across our data center, client and embedded businesses driven by the insatiable demand for more compute,"" she said in a statement. For the quarter, AMD saw adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.8 billion. Wall Street was anticipating adjusted EPS of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg. The company saw EPS of $0.70 per share on revenue of $5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. AMD’s data center business segment — its most important — brought in $3.5 billion versus expectations of $3.46 billion, and from $1.59 billion in Q3 2023. The company’s second-largest segment, its Client business, which involves sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, topped $1.9 billion, versus expectations of $1.71 billion and up from $1.45 billion last year. AMD’s gaming segment, however, collapsed 69% year-over-year, bringing in revenue of $462 million versus $1.5 billion in the same period last year. The gaming segment includes sales of AMD’s Radeon graphics cards for laptops and desktops and custom chips for consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Graphics cards for gaming PCs and console sales have fallen since their peak during the pandemic, which saw consumers buying up devices to help them fill their nights and days when they were stuck inside on the couches. AMD’s earnings come less than a month after the company detailed three of its upcoming chips including its 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) for servers, its Instinct MI325X AI chip, and the Ryzen AI Pro 300 for AI PCs for enterprise users. The chip company's stock price is up 65% in the last 12 months, beating out the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which is up 36%, and clobbering struggling Intel (INTC), whose stock price is down a staggering 34%. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to surge, climbing an eye-watering 246% in the last year. AMD is Nvidia’s biggest rival in the AI chip space. Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that’s not saying much. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) reported revenue ahead of Wall Street’s expectations in Q3 CY2024, with sales up 17.6% year on year to $6.82 billion. On the other hand, the company expects next quarter’s revenue to be around $7.5 billion, slightly below analysts’ estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.92 per share wasin line with analysts’ consensus estimates. Is now the time to buy AMD? Find out in our full research report. Revenue: $6.82 billion vs analyst estimates of $6.71 billion (1.6% beat) Adjusted EPS: $0.92 vs analyst expectations of $0.92 (in line) EBITDA: $1.89 billion vs analyst estimates of $1.49 billion (27% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q4 CY2024 is $7.5 billion at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $7.55 billion Gross Margin (GAAP): 50.1%, in line with the same quarter last year Inventory Days Outstanding: 144, down from 166 in the previous quarter Operating Margin: 10.6%, up from 3.9% in the same quarter last year EBITDA Margin: 27.7%, up from 24.8% in the same quarter last year Free Cash Flow Margin: 7.3%, up from 5.1% in the same quarter last year Market Capitalization: $258.8 billion “We delivered strong third quarter financial results with record revenue led by higher sales of EPYC and Instinct data center products and robust demand for our Ryzen PC processors,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. Founded in 1969 by a group of former Fairchild semiconductor executives led by Jerry Sanders, Advanced Micro Devices or AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the leading designers of computer processors and graphics chips used in PCs and data centers. The biggest demand drivers for processors (CPUs) and graphics chips at the moment are secular trends related to 5G and Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and high performance computing in the data center space, specifically around AI and machine learning. Like all semiconductor companies, digital chip makers exhibit a degree of cyclicality, driven by supply and demand imbalances and exposure to PC and Smartphone product cycles. Examining a company’s long-term performance can provide clues about its business quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but the best consistently grow over the long haul. Thankfully, AMD’s 32.2% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was incredible. This is encouraging because it shows AMD’s offerings resonate with customers, a helpful starting point. Semiconductors are a cyclical industry, and long-term investors should be prepared for periods of high growth followed by periods of revenue contractions. Long-term growth is the most important, but recency is neccessary for semiconductors because of Moore's Law, which suggests the pace of technological innovation is so high that yesterday's hit new product could be obsolete today. AMD’s recent history shows its demand slowed significantly as its annualized revenue growth of 3.2% over the last two years is well below its five-year trend. This quarter, AMD reported year-on-year revenue growth of 17.6%, and its $6.82 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street’s estimates by 1.6%. Management is currently guiding for a 21.6% year-on-year increase next quarter. Looking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 28.1% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is healthy and indicates the market thinks its newer products and services will spur faster growth. When a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares. Click here to claim your Special Free Report on a fallen angel growth story that is already recovering from a setback. Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) is an important metric for chipmakers, as it reflects a business’ capital intensity and the cyclical nature of semiconductor supply and demand. In a tight supply environment, inventories tend to be stable, allowing chipmakers to exert pricing power. Steadily increasing DIO can be a warning sign that demand is weak, and if inventories continue to rise, the company may have to downsize production. This quarter, AMD’s DIO came in at 144, which is 34 days above its five-year average. These numbers suggest that despite the recent decrease, the company’s inventory levels are higher than what we’ve seen in the past. We were impressed by AMD’s strong improvement in inventory levels. We were also excited its EBITDA outperformed Wall Street’s estimates. On the other hand, its revenue guidance for next quarter missed analysts’ expectations. The outlook is weighing on shares, and shares traded down 5.4% to $157.25 immediately following the results.

(Corrects paragraph 1 of Oct. 29 story to say $5 billion AI chip sales forecast is for 2024, not 2025) By Arsheeya Bajwa and Max A. Cherney (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday forecast fourth-quarter revenue just shy of estimates and raised its artificial intelligence chip sales forecast to $5 billion for 2024 - not enough to impress investors. AMD stock slid nearly 7% in extended trading, erasing most of the 8% gain in the last three trading days and much of the more than 10% gained this year. Demand for AI chips from big technology companies including Microsoft and Meta has been rising much faster than their supply from AMD and larger rival Nvidia, limiting the chip companies' ability to tap the order surge. AMD CEO Lisa Su said that supplies of AI chips would be tight going into next year. ""AMD's stock was priced for a beat and raise,"" Summit Insights analyst Kinngai Chan said. ""Clearly, AMD's (fourth-quarter) outlook was not good enough for investors."" Revenue in its data center business, which includes AI chips, surged 122% to $3.5 billion. AMD still trails front-runner Nvidia, which commands about 80% of the AI semiconductor market. Su raised the forecast for AI chips, which are included in the data center segment, by half a billion from the $4.5 billion it estimated in July. In the earnings call with analysts, Su also discussed Microsoft and Meta expanding their use of the company's AI chips. Microsoft and Oracle offer the MI300X chips for rent as part of their cloud computing service. Analysts largely believe Nvidia will maintain its majority market share for the foreseeable future, owing in part to its entire AI ecosystem that includes the CUDA software and networking equipment. Capacity for the production of AI chips will be very tight going into 2025, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer TSMC said in July, marking a significant hurdle for the supply of these advanced semiconductors. AMD's ability to sell more of its advanced AI processors is hampered by the supply constraints at TSMC, Running Point Capital chief investment officer Michael Schulman said. The company expects revenue of $7.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million for the fourth quarter, compared with analysts' average estimate of $7.54 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. AMD forecast an adjusted gross margin of roughly 54%, which met analyst expectations. The company reported revenue of $6.82 billion for the third quarter, compared with estimates of $6.71 billion. AMD reported adjusted earnings of 92 cents a share, in line with analyst expectations. AMD's results weighed on the chip sector in extended trading. Arm Holdings fell 1.7%, Nvidia dropped 0.3%, Intel fell 0.4%. Chip equipment maker Lam Research fell 0.8%. ""Most investors, once they digest AMD’s good results combined with their lackluster forecast, will try to extrapolate what that means for the rest of the AI-chip and semiconductor market,"" Schulman said.

(Reuters) - Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger inherited a troubled company that had lost its edge in manufacturing skills and had ceded to rivals the hugely lucrative markets for chips used in mobile phones and artificial intelligence. 1968 - Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore found Intel, helping reshape California's Santa Clara Valley from fruit orchards into the Silicon Valley tech hub. 1971 - Intel introduces the 4004, the world's first commercially made programmable microprocessor, with 2,300 transistors. These were among the first chips that could be programmed to perform specific functions, unlike previous processors that were hardwired only for a certain task - a turning point in the history of the semiconductor industry that laid the groundwork for the development of CPUs. 1981 - Intel's 8088 microprocessor, with 29,000 transistors, becomes the brain in the IBM Personal Computer, kicking off the era of personal computing. 1982 - Advanced Micro Devices, co-founded in 1969 by a fellow Fairchild Semiconductor alum, becomes a second producer of the Intel 8086 microprocessor. This partnership would later cause a long legal battle over AMD's rights to use Intel's x86 chip architecture, which is the basis of a majority of PC and server chips today. 1985 - Intel decides to withdraw from the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market - its initial claim to fame - as slumping demand prompts it to focus on microprocessors. 1985 - Intel begins cutting its workforce, impacted by an industry-wide downturn brought on by memory over-supply. Intel would lay off thousands of workers for the remainder of the 80's. 1987 - Andy Grove, famous for his motto, ""Only the paranoid survive"", becomes Intel's third CEO and steers the company through a massive slump in the chip market. Intel solidifies its position as a linchpin of the American semiconductor industry, while players like AMD and National Semiconductor struggle. 1991 - Intel launches its ""Intel Inside"" marketing campaign for PCs with its chips, and the television commercials become a cultural phenomenon. 1993 - Intel introduces Pentium microprocessors, boasting 3.1 million transistors and running 300 times faster than the 8088. 1999 - Intel and Windows maker Microsoft, allies referred to as Wintel, become the first two tech companies to be added to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average. 1999 - Nvidia introduces its first graphics processing units (GPU), which during the 2000s would become an important fixture in PCs and servers with the advent of gaming and multimedia applications. Intel's development strategy remained focused on CPUs, Reuters reported, eventually costing it a head start in the AI revolution of the 2020s. 2000 - Driven by the dot-com bubble, Intel's stock market value reaches a record $495 billion as it, Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Dell benefit from an explosion of computer sales. By late 2024, Intel's value would fall below $100 billion. 2007 - Apple launches the iPhone, helping kick off a mobile phone boom that Intel mostly missed. Under CEO Paul Otellini, Intel turned down a deal to make iPhone processors because it did not stand to profit enough from the arrangement. Instead, Apple used chips based on designs from Arm Holdings, whose tech now dominates the mobile market. 2009 - Intel agrees to pay AMD $1.25 billion to settle decades worth of legal disputes, amid increased antitrust scrutiny over Intel's dominance in the chip market. 2013 - Otellini steps down as CEO amid pressure from investors. Former chief operating officer Brian Krzanich becomes CEO, with a focus on diversifying the business beyond PCs to the data center market and automotive chips through acquisitions like Altera and Mobileye. 2014-16 - Under CEO Krzanich, Intel held back on using next-generation equipment used in the extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) technique, crucial for next-generation chips, believing it would ""never work"" and focusing the company's engineers elsewhere. The fateful decision sets back Intel's design and manufacturing businesses for roughly five years. 2016 - Intel cuts 12,000 jobs amid one of the PC industry's worst declines in years. 2017 - Samsung overtakes the U.S. company as the world's largest chipmaker by revenue as prices soared in Samsung's stronghold of the memory market. At the same time, Intel cedes its manufacturing technology lead to Taiwan's TSMC, now the world's largest contract chip manufacturer with customers including Apple. 2018 - Krzanich steps down amid mounting manufacturing setbacks. Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan becomes interim CEO. 2018 - Intel declines an offer to invest in OpenAI; CEO Swan does not believe generative AI will reach market in near future. OpenAI by 2024 has a larger market valuation than Intel. 2020 - Intel's annual revenue peaks at $77.87 billion, bolstered by pandemic sales of PCs. Revenue then declines as Intel struggles with increased competition from AMD and Nvidia. 2020 - Nvidia's market value overtakes Intel's as Nvidia GPUs become the key chip for generative AI technology. 2021 - Pat Gelsinger becomes CEO, winning praise from investors who want a turnaround after manufacturing setbacks and deepening market share losses. Gelsinger focuses on transforming Intel into a producer of chips for other ""fabless"" firms, including his ""five nodes in four years"" plan that would cost billions and sap Intel's cash flow and margins. 2021- Intel announces plans to invest $20 billion to build two manufacturing facilities in Arizona. 2022 - Intel's market value sinks below AMD's as the smaller chipmaker eats away at Intel's share of the server CPU and PC chip market and becomes the most formidable challenger to Nvidia. 2024 - Intel unveils a plan to invest $100 billion across four U.S. states to build and expand factories, after securing federal grants and loans aimed at bolstering U.S. chip manufacturing. 2024 - Intel cuts 17,500 jobs, suspends dividend and embarks on a turnaround of its money-losing manufacturing business.

He further states how third-quarter earnings reports show that AI-focused companies, from software to hardware and even the energy providers that power their data centers, are receiving an inordinate amount of CapEx and continue to benefit from it.

In fact, these “down days” can provide a significant point of entry for investors. According to BofA Securities market analysts Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian, a major “AI arms race” is happening amongst major tech companies. According to their calculations, the capital spending this year from the four major megacaps making AI bets will total $206 billion, up 40% over 2023. Meanwhile, the capital spending by the other 496 companies in the S&P 500 Index is projected to dip slightly, as per their findings. Just like the long-term outlook for AI stocks remains strong, so is the market enthusiasm for these names. Even though it is unclear which companies are going to emerge as the long-term winners, exchange-traded funds focused on AI continue to flood the market. According to data from Morningstar, more than one-third of the ETFs that included artificial intelligence or AI in their name have launched this year alone. Several ETFs have been added to the list recently, with one that has rebranded and shifted focus from cloud computing to specifically AI. Senior analyst Daniel Sotiroff states how he isn’t surprised by recent market developments. It’s a fast-moving and fast-growing industry, he claims, and it is “easy to hope” that one could end up making a lot of money in a short period of time. The 200% plus stock gain by Nvidia over the past year, “reaffirms that confidence”. With that said, artificial intelligence has been making its mark everywhere it goes. In its most recent development, AI startup Sierra, co-founded by Bret Taylor, Chairperson of OpenAI, has increased its valuation to $4.5 billion after a new $175 million funding round led by Greenoaks Capital. Sierra specializes in helping companies personalize and implement AI-driven customer service agents. “We think every company in the world, whether it’s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT, can benefit from AI, and the technology is ready right now. We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.” -Taylor told CNBC in an interview. In other news, Osmo, a digital olfaction company, has launched three new scent molecules through its proprietary artificial intelligence technology. While captive molecules play a significant role in fragrance development, traditional methods of captive discovery have been time-consuming and expensive. Osmo’s AI-driven approach strives to overcome these challenges, reduce costs, and speed up the process both. ""Our AI technology enables us to screen billions of molecules at a rate that would be impossible for humans. This not only speeds up the discovery process but also allows us to identify captives with desirable performance and 'special effects', regulatory compliance, and consumer safety."" - Christophe Laudamiel, The Company’s Master Perfumer Advancements such as these are, no doubt, leading us to bridge the gap towards achieving AGI- or artificial general intelligence. AGI is a type of artificial intelligence that can match or even surpass human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. However, some experts are cautious about AGI. This is what Miles Brundage, former senior advisor for OpenAI’s AGI Readiness, has to say about achieving AGI, alongside his departure from the company: “Neither OpenAI nor any other frontier lab is ready, and the world is also not ready”. With that, let's take a look at the latest AI stocks that are making headlines right now. Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Photo by Javier Esteban on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is an American multinational corporation that specializes in manufacturing semiconductor devices used in computer processing. By integrating technology across CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs, it strives to create a strong ecosystem that supports the development of powerful AI applications. Even though Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has failed to make a significant dent in the AI chips market, Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar continues to view AMD as a “top large-cap pick”. On October 25, the analyst rated AMD shares as Overweight (i.e. Buy), along with a $200 price target. This indicates a potential 26% upside in the coming months. The analyst’s positivity comes from AMD's management's comments regarding the GPU outlook with the prospect of MI300 adoption setting the scene for “outperformance in the data center segment”. He expects the company to exceed the $5 billion annual revenue goal for its GPUs, driven by “implied GPU ramp”. The analyst states that there were also supply constraints at the beginning of the year, but the momentum is building again with the introduction of MI325. “All in all, AMD has taken some significant steps in software/model conversion to eliminate the gap relative to competition. We feel that with the closure of the ZT Systems deal in 1H25, AMD will close another gap to NVDA in rack level performance.”  Overall AMD ranks 6th on our list of the AI stocks you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

news,2024-10-29 11:39:00,Cisco CEO: 2025 is the year of our AI rolling thunder,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-ceo-2025-is-the-year-of-our-ai-rolling-thunder-153936184.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Cisco (CSCO) is breaking out the AI thunder. On Tuesday at its annual Partner Summit conference in Los Angeles, Cisco unveiled a new high-density GPU server for customers who want to train large language models. It also took the wraps off ""AI PODS,"" a product designed for clients keen on inferencing, the process artificial intelligence models use to derive conclusions from new data. Cisco said both products are built to handle intensive AI workloads powered by Nvidia's (NVDA) accelerated computing. ""It's really an important event for us, and we've taken the opportunity here to start what is really a rolling thunder of announcements around AI infrastructure,"" Cisco chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins told Yahoo Finance. Robbins is aiming to keep the momentum going with Cisco's foray into AI. The company has shipped $1 billion of orders to five of the six top hyperscalers. It expects another $1 billion in its current fiscal year. ""I think 2025 is going to be the year of the enterprise application,"" Robbins added. ""I think we've seen this focus on the training models that are out there and ChatGPT and Anthropic, and you got all these models that people are using. And I think now the enterprises are really figuring out what are the use cases that we can deploy."" The AI product drop comes as Cisco's stock has begun to perk up after being largely dead money for the past year amid several challenging quarters. Shares of the networking giant are up nearly 20% in the past three months, outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 7% advance. Rival Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) stock is down 3% in the last months. Cisco's stock has still underperformed, gaining only 9% in the past year compared to a 40% improvement in the S&P 500. The stock's recent resurgence stems from better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter earnings in mid-August. Cisco surprised some on the Street by delivering product order growth of 14% and sounding optimistic about the integration of its $28 billion purchase of Splunk. The Street is also growing comfortable that Cisco will have a key role in building out the world's AI infrastructure like it helped lay the structural pipes as the internet took off in the 1990s and early 2000s. Networking sales —a key driver of sentiment on Cisco's stock — rebounded in the quarter, spurring hope for further gains over the next 12 months. ""We do think there is a lot of upside potential in the current guidance, and critically, there are multiple levers for upside in FY25 across revenues and margins,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients. Daryanani says a successful integration of Splunk and ongoing improvement in networking demand is key to his Outperform rating on Cisco's stock. Daryanani added, ""Our upside scenario would require both great execution and end market recovery, but we think it is a possibility."" Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AMD (AMD) will report its fiscal third quarter earnings after the bell on Tuesday, in what will serve as a temperature check on the health of the artificial intelligence market. AI continues to drive shares of tech giants ranging from AMD rival Nvidia (NVDA) to customers like Microsoft (MSFT), and investors and analysts are hoping to see their big bets pay off. AMD’s earnings come less than a month after the company detailed three of its upcoming chips including its 5th Gen AMD EPYC central processing unit (CPU) for servers, its Instinct MI325X AI chip, and the Ryzen AI Pro 300 for AI PCs for enterprise users. Shares of the chip company are up 65% in the last 12 months, beating out the broader S&P 500 (GSPC), which is up 36%, and clobbering struggling Intel (INTC), whose stock price is down a staggering 34%. Nvidia, meanwhile, continues to surge, climbing an eye-watering 246% in the last year. AMD is Nvidia’s biggest rival in the AI chip space. Of course, with Nvidia estimated to have between 75% and 90% of the market, that’s not saying much. For the quarter, AMD is expected to bring in adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.7 billion, based on analyst consensus estimates from Bloomberg. That’s up from $0.70 per share and $5.8 billion in the same quarter last year. AMD’s data center business segment — its most important — is set to bring in $3.46 billion, up from $1.59 billion in Q3 2023. Analysts are expecting $1.39 billion from its AI/GPU revenue alone. The company’s second-largest segment, its Client business, which involves sales of CPUs for desktops and laptops, is set to bring in $1.71 billion, versus $1.45 billion last year. AMD’s gaming segment, however, is projected to drop in a big way. Analysts anticipate the business will bring in $572 million in the quarter. That’s nearly a $1 billion decline from the same period last year. The gaming segment includes sales of AMD’s Radeon graphics cards for laptops and desktops and custom chips for consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Graphics cards for gaming PCs and console sales have fallen since their peak during the pandemic, which saw consumers buying up devices to help them fill their nights and days when they were stuck inside on the couches.

AMD (AMD) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings on Tuesday, meeting expectations on earnings per share and beating on revenue. But Wall Street wasn't too keen on the company's Q4 revenue outlook, which it said will come in between $7.2 billion and $7.8 billion. Wall Street was looking for $7.55 billion. The chipmaker's stock fell more than 5% immediately following the announcement on fears of slowing artificial intelligence growth for the company. Despite that, CEO Lisa Su said demand for the company's offerings is strong. ""Looking forward, we see significant growth opportunities across our data center, client and embedded businesses driven by the insatiable demand for more compute,"" she said in a statement. For the quarter, AMD saw adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 on revenue of $6.8 billion.

news,2024-10-28 08:49:00,AMD gains as Northland says share gains likely to continue,Investing.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-gains-northland-says-share-124919344.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Investing.com -- Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) (NASDAQ:AMD) rose on Monday during pre-market trading after analysts at Northland Capital Markets said that they believe that the company will report revenue at or above the high end of its guidance for the third quarter in a note dated Monday. “We expect AMD to continue to gain a share in server CPUs and AI accelerators in CY25. Slowing earnings growth will likely be OPEX as AMD invests billions of dollars to capture tens of billions of future annual revenue,” the analysts said. The anticipated revenue increase is expected to boost AMD's bottom line, with non-GAAP earnings likely surpassing the consensus estimate of $0.92 per share. The analysts flagged AMD's ability to gain market share in the server CPU segment, a trend that has been bolstered by improvements in the enterprise market over the last three months. There are signs that demand for non-AI server products is also picking up, contributing to AMD's momentum in data center AI solutions. Northland expects AMD to guide for revenue above consensus for the fourth quarter, fueled by ongoing strength in its AI, server CPU, and client product lines. The analysts do not expect AMD to provide guidance for calendar year 2025 during the upcoming earnings report, which is anticipated in January 2025. However, they noted a sharp increase in AMD’s revenue share in the server market, rising from just 2% in 2019 to 34% in the first half of 2024. This growth has been attributed to AMD's competitive product offerings, which continue to outperform those of its main rival, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Additionally, early performance benchmarks suggest that AMD will maintain its upward trajectory in market share with the next generation of server CPUs expected to launch in 2025. AMD’s share in the AI accelerator market is also projected to grow, with estimates indicating an increase from 0.7% in 2023 to 3.9% in 2024. Analysts at Northland believe that AMD will continue to capture a larger slice of the accelerator market moving forward, especially as NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) faces delays with its Blackwell product family. The expected release of AMD’s next-generation MI325x accelerators in early 2025 is expected to position the company well against NVIDIA's offerings, further solidifying its market presence. The shift toward AMD is partly driven by cloud service providers' (CSPs) desire for alternatives to NVIDIA, as indicated by year-over-year growth in AMD's AI revenue. Analysts at Northland estimate that AMD could potentially double its market share over the next two years, thanks to strategic partnerships with industry giants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Hugging Face. Beyond 2025, Northland's projections suggest that AMD could generate between $18 billion and $28 billion in AI revenue by 2027, representing 6.2% to 9.7% of the AI accelerator market. The total revenue for AMD in 2027 could range from $45 billion to $55 billion, contingent on steady growth in its other product lines. Analysts estimate potential earnings power of $6 to $9 per share by that time, although operating expenses remain a major variable in these projections. While there are concerns regarding AMD's necessary investments to catch up with NVIDIA, Northland asserts that the company’s share gains against Intel demonstrate the long-term value of AMD's strategic investments.

Computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) will be reporting results tomorrow after the bell. Here’s what to expect. AMD beat analysts’ revenue expectations by 2% last quarter, reporting revenues of $5.84 billion, up 8.9% year on year. It was a strong quarter for the company, with an impressive beat of analysts’ EBITDA estimates and a significant improvement in its gross margin. Is AMD a buy or sell going into earnings? Read our full analysis here, it’s free. This quarter, analysts are expecting AMD’s revenue to grow 15.8% year on year to $6.71 billion, improving from the 4.2% increase it recorded in the same quarter last year. Adjusted earnings are expected to come in at $0.92 per share. The majority of analysts covering the company have reconfirmed their estimates over the last 30 days, suggesting they anticipate the business to stay the course heading into earnings. AMD has only missed Wall Street’s revenue estimates once over the last two years, exceeding top-line expectations by 0.8% on average. Looking at AMD’s peers in the semiconductors segment, some have already reported their Q3 results, giving us a hint as to what we can expect. SMART’s revenues decreased 1.7% year on year, missing analysts’ expectations by 4.3%, and Micron Technology reported revenues up 93.3%, topping estimates by 1.4%. SMART’s stock price was unchanged after the results, while Micron Technology was up 14.6%. Read our full analysis of SMART’s results here and Micron Technology’s results here. Investors in the semiconductors segment have had fairly steady hands going into earnings, with share prices down 1.4% on average over the last month. AMD is down 4.8% during the same time and is heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $188.06 (compared to the current share price of $156.15). Unless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.
