Investors aren't impressed by the weakness in non-AI segments as well as a lower-than-expected guidance. We believe the stock is worth taking a deeper look at, especially with AI infrastructure investments continuing to dominate Big Tech spending. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD), an American fabless semiconductor company, conceptualizes, develops, and sells computer processors and related technologies for diverse markets, from consumer to business. Founded in 1968 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the company gained a dominant market position due to its cutting-edge computing and graphics technologies, coupled with the transition to a fabless structural model that initiates outsourcing manufacturing to an external party such as GlobalFoundries. AMD deals in a variety of products, namely microprocessors, graphics processors, motherboard chipsets, Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), Accelerated Processing Units (APUs), and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In a recent development, AMD disclosed its “Zen 5” Ryzen processors for an Advanced AI experience. Although CPUs and GPUs are the major revenue drivers, over the years, the enterprise range has witnessed growing demand stemming from data centers and cloud computing growth. AMD reported an impressive $5.8 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2024, with a gross margin of 49%. The third quarter also beat analyst estimates, with the revenue coming in at $6.8 billion, powered by AI revenue. The primary clients of AMD include key technology companies, PC manufacturers like Dell and HP, and gaming console makers, particularly Sony (PlayStation) and Microsoft (Xbox). AMD serves a range of end markets, including personal computing, data centers, embedded systems, gaming, and robustly performing computing applications. It is the data center market that we will focus on. AMD reported a staggering 122% growth in the Data Center segment. The growth has come both from sales of EPYC CPUs and AMD Instinct GPUs. AMD is expected to continue to face inconsistent and cyclical AI spending from its primary clients. However, over a longer duration of time, this should not bother investors. Estimates put the total AI spending for the rest of the decade at over $500 billion. While AMD is no Nvidia, it is still a dominant market player and stands to benefit from this spending. For the above reason, the weakness in the gaming segment (69% YoY decline) and the Embedded segment (25% YoY decline) shouldn't worry investors. The company needs to divert its energy to the segment that is growing the fastest. AI is a fast developing technology and AMD wants to strike while the iron is hot. This might sound like a short-term focus for AMD, but controlling the market in the short term is what will put AMD at the center of other businesses's AI infrastructure. Once that happens, future revenue will eventually trickle down to the bottom line. For us, the 'poor' earnings report is a buying opportunity! AMD ranks 18th on our latest list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 108 hedge fund portfolios held AMD at the end of the second quarter which was 124 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:AMD) shares are trading lower by 14% to $142.44 since Wednesday’s open after the company reported third-quarter results. The company posted revenue of $6.8 billion, which exceeded analyst expectations of $6.71 billion. Earnings per share aligned with projections at 92 cents. What To Know: AMD’s data center segment was the driving force behind the company’s growth, achieving a 122% increase to $3.5 billion. The company also saw a 29% rise in client segment revenue, totaling $1.9 billion. However, gaming revenue experienced a steep decline of 69% to $462 million, and embedded revenue fell 25% to $927 million, though embedded revenue saw an 8% sequential quarterly increase.

Each advisor has been vetted by SmartAsset and is held to a fiduciary standard to act in your best interests. CEO Lisa Su attributed AMD's results to high demand for the company's EPYC and Instinct data center products, as well as Ryzen processors in the PC segment. She also projected further growth opportunities across data center, client and embedded business sectors, driven by escalating demand for computing power. Looking ahead, AMD forecasts fourth-quarter revenue of $7.5 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Adjusted gross margins for the fourth-quarter are expected to remain consistent at 54%.

Analyst Reactions: The company's expansion in artificial intelligence (AI) and data center solutions has drawn positive reactions from analysts, who suggest AMD could increasingly challenge its main competitor, NVIDIA, in the AI domain. KeyBanc analyst John Vinh noted the importance of AMD's MI300 chip, which is projected to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2024. Vinh believes that this chip could broaden customer adoption across cloud and AI applications, despite conservative fourth quarter guidance. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse pointed out that AMD's AI progress with the MI300 may eventually generate $12 billion in revenue, supporting potential earnings growth by 2025 or 2026, even though he anticipates a short-term trading range for AMD shares. Other analysts provided mixed assessments. Oppenheimer’s Rick Schafer commended AMD's rapid establishment of a competitive AI franchise, projected to surpass $5 billion in annual revenue, though he suggested that investor expectations might be overly ambitious. Meanwhile, Piper Sandler's Harsh Kumar highlighted strong GPU execution but acknowledged challenging guidance, noting that while AMD's GPU and server segments are promising, gaming and embedded segments pose risks.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) has a Gaudi problem on its hands – the chipmaker revealed that its AI accelerator won't even make $500 million in 2024, falling short of CEO Pat Gelsinger's target of $1 billion to $2 billion. What Happened: Gelsinger revealed during Intel's third-quarter earnings call that the Gaudi AI accelerator program will fall short of revenue targets due to a transition from second to third generation. ""The overall uptake of Gaudi has been slower than we anticipated as adoption rates were impacted by the product transition from Gaudi 2 to Gaudi 3 and software ease of use,"" Gelsinger said.

This comes at a critical time for Intel – the iconic chipmaker's stock is down nearly 55% in 2024 so far, which has drawn attention from rival Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM), which is reportedly eyeing a takeover of Intel. While it is not clear if this will eventually materialize, it points to a weak phase that Intel is going through. Three of the biggest chip makers – Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), Intel, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

While Intel led in 2022, the company's data center revenue started declining in 2023, coinciding with Nvidia's rise. On the other hand, 2022 and 2023 were both lukewarm for AMD, but it started gathering pace in the fourth quarter of 2023. Here's how Nvidia, Intel, and AMD's data center business has performed since 2022.  Period Nvidia Intel AMD Q1 2022 $3.8B $6.1B $1.3B Q2 2022 $3.8B $4.7B $1.5B Q3 2022 $3.8B $4.4B $1.6B Q4 2022 $3.6B $4.6B $1.7B Q1 2023 $4.3B $3.7B $1.3B Q2 2023 $10.3B $4.0B $1.3B Q3 2023 $14.5B $3.8B $1.6B Q4 2023 $18.4B $4B $2.3B Q1 2024 $22.6B $3B $2.3B Q2 2024 $26.3B $3B $2.8B Q3 2024 TBA $3.3B $3.5B Source: Nvidia, Intel, and AMD | Nvidia's Q3 2024 results have not been announced yet.

Nvidia's current market capitalization stands at $3.256 trillion, while Intel's is $92.73 billion and AMD's is $233.8 billion. Gelsinger maintained an optimistic outlook, saying ""We remain encouraged by the market available to us. There is a clear need for solutions with superior [total cost of ownership] based on open standards, and we are continuing to enhance the Gaudi value proposition.""

news,2024-11-01 14:09:00,"Jim Cramer on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD): The Stock Got Slammed In The After-hours Trading",Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-advanced-micro-devices-180914615.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer on AMD and Other Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, expressed concerns about the impact of rising bond yields on the stock market, suggesting that this trend could restrict the recent tech rally and limit broader sector gains. On Tuesday, he remarked that the bond market is creating significant disruptions, stating: “Bonds are wrecking the narrative, driving the people outta everything that works when the Fed cuts rates and they're going right back into tech. That's the opposite of what, if you're a true bull, you want to see.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 20 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: 11 Stocks to Watch Despite the Dow experiencing a modest decline of 155 points, the S&P 500 managed a slight increase of 0.16%, while the NASDAQ achieved a record close with a 0.78% rise on Tuesday. Cramer pointed out that the market is becoming increasingly narrow and exclusive, primarily benefiting tech stocks at the expense of broader participation, which he considers unhealthy. Cramer explained that this trend was somewhat anticipated. He recounted how, when news broke about the Fed potentially implementing a 50 basis point rate cut, there was a surge of enthusiasm among investors who began buying bonds. They were betting on a series of rapid rate cuts, leading to expectations that bond yields would fall. Cramer noted, “It seemed a total legit thing, right? I mean the economy was slowing, that's been the pattern historically.” He added that as inflation began to ease, it appeared that history was repeating itself. However, following the significant rate cut on September 18th, something unusual occurred: long-term rates rose for the first time since 1995. This shift, which he described as a “total buzzkill,” is beginning to manifest in corporate earnings reports. He went on to say: “If the bond market doesn’t start behaving, or at least calming down, if longer-term interest rates don’t stop going up, we’re going to start losing the groups that have led us higher for months now.” In conclusion, Cramer warned: “If it [the bond market] doesn't stop its retreat, then we're gonna start questioning the idea that the Fed will keep cutting rates, ushering in a fabulous economy for 2025, which is what I was looking for.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 7 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on October 29. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds.

A close up of a complex looking PCB board with several intergrated semiconductor parts. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Talking about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Cramer said: “AMD reported a strong set of results this evening, partially fueled by demand for their AI chips, the only ones that come close to Nvidia’s. However, they also gave you some not-so-hot guidance for the current quarter because they're worried about supply constraints. The demand for these chips is off the charts, but they may not be able to make enough of them because there's only so much high-end semiconductor capacity worldwide. Now to me, silly little me, that seemed like a high-quality problem. But it's a problem nonetheless, which is why the stock got slammed in the after-hours trading.” Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) has emerged as a prominent company within the semiconductor sector, particularly gaining favor among personal computer manufacturers. On October 29, the company released its third-quarter financial results, which met market expectations for earnings while exceeding sales projections. In this quarter, it reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.92, accompanied by revenues of $6.82 billion. This revenue surpassed Wall Street's average forecast of $6.71 billion, indicating a stronger-than-anticipated sales performance during this period. However, despite these positive figures, management's forward guidance raised concerns among investors, reflecting a cautious outlook. During Advanced Micro Devices’ (NASDAQ:AMD) earnings call, CEO Lisa Su addressed the current supply chain situation, stating that while the environment remains challenging, the company has effectively managed its capacity throughout the supply chain. Su emphasized that while the company expects continued tightness in supply in the coming quarters, there are plans for significant growth leading into 2025.

(NASDAQ:AMD) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. On October 31, CNBC’s Steve Kovach joined ‘Money Movers’ to discuss big tech’s AI spending. Kovach observes that, apart from ChatGPT, no other AI product has achieved a breakthrough, despite ongoing efforts from many companies. Currently, most of the money is going to chip makers and cloud businesses, and there is no evidence of meaningful sales or engagement around AI products that people may want to use every day. Kovach's observation implies that tech giants continue to invest heavily in foundational AI advancements and that high-engagement consumer products may still have time to launch. Additionally, many of these big tech companies have reported that they will continue to step up their already high spending on AI infrastructure.

The company claims that Ryzen™ AI 9 HX 375 processor achieves up to 27% faster performance than its competition when looking at tokens per second, which is a key metric for LLM performance. Another benchmark proving AMD’s processor superiority is its “time to first token”. The time to first token measures the latency between the moment you submit a prompt and the time it takes for the model to start generating tokens. As per the company, the AMD Ryzen™ AI HX 375 processor is up to 3.5x faster than a comparable competitor in larger language models.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) reported its third quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, beating expectations on revenue but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. Positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher, with the chipmaker's stock up over 8% Friday. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. For the fourth quarter, Intel said it expects revenue of between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Wall Street was anticipating $13.6 billion. The company also said it has two new customers for its 18A processor. Revenue for the company's data center and AI business came in at $3.35 billion; analysts were looking for $3.1 billion. Intel's Client Computing segment, which deals with the sale of chips for laptops and desktops, brought in revenue of $7.3 billion, versus expectations of $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion in revenue during the same quarter last year. Intel’s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, saw revenue of $4.35 billion. Wall Street was looking for $4.4 billion. The division saw revenue of $4.7 billion in Q3 2023. Intel is dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash. Intel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success. Intel’s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel’s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short. Intel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that’s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there’s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they fell slightly in Q3, according to Gartner. The company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel’s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years. It’s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company’s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before. Qualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance. Intel’s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company’s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.

news,2024-10-31 20:15:00,"Intel CEO calls TSMC an 'awesome' company, says the company is still waiting for CHIPS Act money",Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-ceo-calls-tsmc-an-awesome-company-says-the-company-is-still-waiting-for-chips-act-money-001504215.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Another kitchen sink type of earnings day from chip giant Intel (INTC). Intel stock (INTC) rose slightly in premarket trading on Friday as the struggling US icon managed to serve up better-than-expected fourth quarter guidance. Shares had been up about 8% late Thursday, but a cautious earnings call subdued sentiment. ""This was a critical quarter for us, and I think [it] gives optimism for what is to come,"" Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance moments after the company's earnings call ended (video above). The somewhat positive market reaction may be a tad overdone when digging into the quarterly results. Intel revealed $15.9 billion in total non-cash charges related to inventory write-downs and lower performance expectations for certain businesses, such as autonomous driving firm Mobileye (MBLY), where it owns a majority stake. The company reported a $5.8 billion operating loss at Intel Foundry — Intel's upstart chipmaking business — on $4.4 billion in sales. Intel took a cautious stance on the health of the foundry business and its artificial intelligence product roadmap in 2025. ""The bad news, in our view, is that Intel's AI strategy appears to have changed again, now with what seems to be a longer-term approach that centers on the traditional CPU+co-processor/accelerator approach to Enterprise class AI workloads,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy said in a client note on Friday. On the earnings call, management promised to continue executing a $10 billion cost-cutting plan and exploring alternative sources of funding to support chipmaking ambitions. Gelsinger told Yahoo Finance that no deal is imminent in terms of external funding. He reiterated that Intel will push forward with opening chipmaking plants in states like Ohio and Arizona despite not receiving billions of dollars in funding yet from the CHIPS Act. The Biden administration has earmarked $8.5 billion in direct funding to Intel for its projects, but the company is still awaiting the cash as government officials iron out milestones that it must hit. ""Overall, we are seeing the CHIPS Act as a critical thing that we've invested a lot of time and energy into, and as we said on our earnings call, we're disappointed by the time that it's taken to get done,"" Gelsinger said. ""It's well over two years since the CHIPS Act passed. And over that period, I've invested $30 billion in US manufacturing and we've seen $0 from the CHIPS Act. This has taken too long. We need to get it finished."" To be sure, Wall Street still sees a bumpy road ahead for Intel. Intel faces an ""uphill battle"" to turn itself around and compete with the likes of Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Taiwan's TSMC (TSM), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari recently told Yahoo Finance. He added the company will need some time to get its technology — notably AI chips — on par with its rivals, if they can do it at all. And BofA analyst Vivek Arya struck a cautious tone on Intel in a new episode of the Opening Bid podcast (listen here). Gelsinger also clarified the company's relationship with TSMC to Yahoo Finance. Reuters reported that Gelsinger made comments early on in his Intel tenure that strained the relationship with the semiconductor manufacturing giant. In turn, TSMC pulled a discount it was giving Intel on 3-nanometer wafers. ""They are an awesome company. They have just created the foundry model. They service customers extremely well, and they service us well. And, Lunar Lake, the AI PC that we spoke about, we couldn't do it without TSMC — they've been critical to that project's success,"" Gelsinger said. ""That said, we want to be a Western foundry at scale, and we think that's seminally important for the Western world. ... And finally, I supply them with some of our advanced equipment as well. So it's a complex relationship but critically important for Intel, for TSMC, for the industry,"" added Gelsinger, who called TSMC a customer and a competitor that they have a great partnership with.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell nearly 5% Thursday on investor fears of a slowdown in artificial intelligence spending and potential delivery delays of its AI chips. Semiconductor stocks suffered across the board. The PHLX semiconductor index (^SOX) fell 4%, slumping more than the broader market. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 3%, while Intel dropped 3.5%, Qualcomm (QCOM) sank 2.9%, and Broadcom (AVGO) tumbled 3.9%. Arm (ARM), meanwhile, plunged 8.5%. Microsoft (MSFT), in its earnings report late Wednesday, indicated that delayed shipments of GPUs (i.e. AI chips, or graphics processing units) from “third parties” weighed on its guidance for its AI cloud business in the current quarter. Microsoft primarily uses Nvidia’s GPUs in data centers to power its artificial intelligence software. “Microsoft said they are not meeting current demand because they can’t get data centers up in time, which could indicate they are not getting the NVDA chips they depend on in time to support their customers,” wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria in an email to Yahoo Finance. Nvidia did not immediately respond to Yahoo Finance's request for comment. Persistent fears of a slowdown in spending among AI hyperscalers also contributed to Nvidia's drop in share price. Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood suggested in a call with analysts Wednesday evening that its growth in AI-fueled spending will eventually ease, but was vague about when that would happen. “As long as we continue to see that [AI-related cloud] demand grow … the growth in capex will slow and the revenue growth will increase,” she said. “The pace of that entirely depends really on the pace of adoption.” Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), in its third quarter earnings report, said that its capital expenditures would not increase in the fourth quarter. “As we look forward, we are working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities,” said CFO Anat Ashkenazi on a call with analysts Tuesday following the company’s results. He added that while spending will increase in 2025, it will be “likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24.” Advanced Micro Devices’ quarterly earnings results on Tuesday contributed to investor concerns as well, as the company’s fourth quarter sales outlook came in slightly lower than expected. The chipmaker expects revenue of $7.5 billion for the current quarter, compared to the $7.55 billion forecast by analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The softer-than-expected guidance weighed heavily on AMD shares, which suffered their biggest single-day loss in two years on Wednesday. To be sure, Big Tech companies’ AI bills are still climbing to massive sums. Microsoft’s capital expenditures nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $20 billion in its most recent quarterly report, while Meta's (META) expenses rose 36% to $9.2 billion over the same period. Google’s capital expenditures jumped 63% to $13 billion. Those bills themselves caused separate investor concerns that weighed on megacap tech stocks Thursday. Meta said it expects ""significant capital expenditure growth in 2025."" Nvidia reports third quarter earnings Nov. 20. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 84% to $0.74 and revenue to climb 83% to $33 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

news,2024-10-31 11:51:00,Intel to report Q3 earnings as Wall Street looks for signs of improvements at chipmaker,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-to-report-q3-earnings-as-wall-street-looks-for-signs-of-improvements-at-chipmaker-155136248.html,"We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) is set to report its Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday as the chip giant continues to contend with a troubled turnaround that’s sent its stock plummeting 52% year to date at a time when shares of rival Nvidia are soaring 154%. Intel is also dealing with the fallout from a Reuters report detailing missteps at the firm, including issues with its 18A chip manufacturing process and the dissolution of a potential deal with Waymo to provide chips to the self-driving car company to save cash. For the quarter, Intel is expected to report a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the company’s Client Computing segment, which deals with sales of chips for laptops and desktops, is expected to decline 5% to $7.4 billion versus $7.8 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenue for Intel’s Foundry business, which is responsible for making chips for Intel and for third-party customers, is also expected to drop some 6% to $4.4 billion versus $4.7 billion in Q3 2023. The company is, however, expected to report growth in its data center and AI segment, with revenue set to climb to $3.1 billion from $3 billion last year. It’s not exactly an earth-shattering improvement, but it’s something. Intel also had some good news in the quarter. In September, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to build custom chips for Amazon Web Services (AMZN). Microsoft (MSFT) also previously entered into an agreement for Intel to build its custom chips. But the company will need to add a slew of additional customers to ensure its foundry business is a success. Intel’s Foundry services have run into trouble before. According to a separate Reuters report, Broadcom was evaluating using Intel’s manufacturing processes for its own chips, but test runs of the semiconductors fell short. Intel has also struggled amid a prolonged slump in PC chip sales that’s only beginning to improve and increased competition from AMD (AMD). But there’s hope on the horizon, as PC sales are beginning to pick up again, though they dipped slightly in Q3, according to Gartner. The company also launched its second-generation Core Ultra chips for laptops, which are designed to handle AI tasks and better compete with Qualcomm’s (QCOM) own Arm-based chips in terms of battery life. Intel’s laptop chips have been energy hogs for years. It’s part of the reason Apple (AAPL) decided to ditch the company’s processors in favor of designing its own Arm-based chips. Since then, Apple has managed to squeeze out more power and battery life from its systems than ever before. Qualcomm and its Snapdragon X Elite chips also offer impressive battery life compared to competing Intel-based machines. But the second-gen Core Ultra is set to change that, using less power while offering comparable performance. Intel’s Client business is still incredibly important, bringing in the majority of the company’s revenue, so any potential to increase sales there could be a boon for the chip builder.
